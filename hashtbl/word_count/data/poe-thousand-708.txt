                  THE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE

                               by Edgar Allan Poe

             Truth is stranger than fiction.

                                                OLD SAYING.

  HAVING had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental
investigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsoornot, a work which
(like the Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at all, even in
Europe; and which has never been quoted, to my knowledge, by any
American- if we except, perhaps, the author of the "Curiosities of
American Literature";- having had occasion, I say, to turn over some
pages of the first- mentioned very remarkable work, I was not a little
astonished to discover that the literary world has hitherto been
strangely in error respecting the fate of the vizier's daughter,
Scheherazade, as that fate is depicted in the "Arabian Nights"; and
that the denouement there given, if not altogether inaccurate, as
far as it goes, is at least to blame in not having gone very much
farther.

  For full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the
inquisitive reader to the "Isitsoornot" itself, but in the meantime, I
shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I there discovered.

  It will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a
certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not only
puts her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the prophet, to
espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and the
next morning to deliver her up to the executioner.

  Having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with a
religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon
him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was interrupted
one afternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand
vizier, to whose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.

  Her name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would either
redeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty, or
perish, after the approved fashion of all heroines, in the attempt.

  Accordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year (which
makes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her father, the
grand vizier, to make an offer to the king of her hand. This hand
the king eagerly accepts- (he had intended to take it at all events,
and had put off the matter from day to day, only through fear of the
vizier),- but, in accepting it now, he gives all parties very
distinctly to understand, that, grand vizier or no grand vizier, he
has not the slightest design of giving up one iota of his vow or of
his privileges. When, therefore, the fair Scheherazade insisted upon
marrying the king, and did actually marry him despite her father's
excellent advice not to do any thing of the kind- when she would and
did marry him, I say, will I, nill I, it was with her beautiful
black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow.

  It seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading
Machiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in her
mind. On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I forget what
specious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near
that of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to
bed; and, a little before cock-crowing, she took care to awaken the
good monarch, her husband (who bore her none the worse will because he
intended to wring her neck on the morrow),- she managed to awaken him,
I say, (although on account of a capital conscience and an easy
digestion, he slept well) by the profound interest of a story (about a
rat and a black cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an
undertone, of course) to her sister. When the day broke, it so
happened that this history was not altogether finished, and that
Scheherazade, in the nature of things could not finish it just then,
since it was high time for her to get up and be bowstrung- a thing
very little more pleasant than hanging, only a trifle more genteel.

  The king's curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say, even
over his sound religious principles, induced him for this once to
postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning, for the purpose
and with the hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with
the black cat (a black cat, I think it was) and the rat.

  The night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only
put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat was
blue) but before she well knew what she was about, found herself
deep in the intricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am
not altogether mistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings) that went,
in a violent manner, by clockwork, and was wound up with an indigo
key. With this history the king was even more profoundly interested
than with the other- and, as the day broke before its conclusion
(notwithstanding all the queen's endeavors to get through with it in
time for the bowstringing), there was again no resource but to
postpone that ceremony as before, for twenty-four hours. The next
night there happened a similar accident with a similar result; and
then the next- and then again the next; so that, in the end, the
good monarch, having been unavoidably deprived of all opportunity to
keep his vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one
nights, either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time,
or gets himself absolved of it in the regular way, or (what is more
probable) breaks it outright, as well as the head of his father
confessor. At all events, Scheherazade, who, being lineally
descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the whole seven baskets
of talk, which the latter lady, we all know, picked up from under
the trees in the garden of Eden-Scheherazade, I say, finally
triumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.

  Now, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it
upon record) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant- but
alas! like a great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than true,
and I am indebted altogether to the "Isitsoornot" for the means of
correcting the error. "Le mieux," says a French proverb, "est l'ennemi
du bien," and, in mentioning that Scheherazade had inherited the seven
baskets of talk, I should have added that she put them out at compound
interest until they amounted to seventy-seven.

  "My dear sister," said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I
quote the language of the "Isitsoornot" at this point, verbatim) "my
dear sister," said she, "now that all this little difficulty about the
bowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is so happily
repealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great indiscretion in
withholding from you and the king (who I am sorry to say, snores- a
thing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion of Sinbad the sailor.
This person went through numerous other and more interesting
adventures than those which I related; but the truth is, I felt sleepy
on the particular night of their narration, and so was seduced into
cutting them short- a grievous piece of misconduct, for which I only
trust that Allah will forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to
remedy my great neglect- and as soon as I have given the king a
pinch or two in order to wake him up so far that he may stop making
that horrible noise, I will forthwith entertain you (and him if he
pleases) with the sequel of this very remarkable story.

  Hereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the
"Isitsoornot," expressed no very particular intensity of
gratification; but the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at
length ceased snoring, and finally said, "hum!" and then "hoo!" when
the queen, understanding these words (which are no doubt Arabic) to
signify that he was all attention, and would do his best not to
snore any more- the queen, I say, having arranged these matters to her
satisfaction, re-entered thus, at once, into the history of Sinbad the
sailor:

  "'At length, in my old age, [these are the words of Sinbad
himself, as retailed by Scheherazade]- 'at length, in my old age,
and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home, I became once
more possessed of a desire of visiting foreign countries; and one day,
without acquainting any of my family with my design, I packed up
some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious and least bulky,
and, engaged a porter to carry them, went with him down to the
sea-shore, to await the arrival of any chance vessel that might convey
me out of the kingdom into some region which I had not as yet
explored.

  "'Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down
beneath some trees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of
perceiving a ship, but during several hours we saw none whatever. At
length I fancied that I could hear a singular buzzing or humming
sound; and the porter, after listening awhile, declared that he also
could distinguish it. Presently it grew louder, and then still louder,
so that we could have no doubt that the object which caused it was
approaching us. At length, on the edge of the horizon, we discovered a
black speck, which rapidly increased in size until we made it out to
be a vast monster, swimming with a great part of its body above the
surface of the sea. It came toward us with inconceivable swiftness,
throwing up huge waves of foam around its breast, and illuminating all
that part of the sea through which it passed, with a long line of fire
that extended far off into the distance.

  "'As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length was
equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and it was
as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace, O most sublime
and munificent of the Caliphs. Its body, which was unlike that of
ordinary fishes, was as solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness
throughout all that portion of it which floated above the water,
with the exception of a narrow blood-red streak that completely
begirdled it. The belly, which floated beneath the surface, and of
which we could get only a glimpse now and then as the monster rose and
fell with the billows, was entirely covered with metallic scales, of a
color like that of the moon in misty weather. The back was flat and
nearly white, and from it there extended upwards of six spines,
about half the length of the whole body.

  "'The horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive, but, as
if to make up for this deficiency, it was provided with at least
four score of eyes, that protruded from their sockets like those of
the green dragon-fly, and were arranged all around the body in two
rows, one above the other, and parallel to the blood-red streak, which
seemed to answer the purpose of an eyebrow. Two or three of these
dreadful eyes were much larger than the others, and had the appearance
of solid gold.

  "'Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with the
greatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by necromancy-
for it had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor
wings like the seashell which is blown along in the manner of a
vessel; nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do the eels. Its
head and its tail were shaped precisely alike, only, not far from
the latter, were two small holes that served for nostrils, and through
which the monster puffed out its thick breath with prodigious
violence, and with a shrieking, disagreeable noise.

  "'Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but
it was even surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a
nearer look, we perceived upon the creature's back a vast number of
animals about the size and shape of men, and altogether much
resembling them, except that they wore no garments (as men do),
being supplied (by nature, no doubt) with an ugly uncomfortable
covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting so tight to the skin, as
to render the poor wretches laughably awkward, and put them apparently
to severe pain. On the very tips of their heads were certain
square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I thought might have been
intended to answer as turbans, but I soon discovered that they were
excessively heavy and solid, and I therefore concluded they were
contrivances designed, by their great weight, to keep the heads of the
animals steady and safe upon their shoulders. Around the necks of
the creatures were fastened black collars, (badges of servitude, no
doubt,) such as we keep on our dogs, only much wider and infinitely
stiffer, so that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to
move their heads in any direction without moving the body at the
same time; and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of
their noses- a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not
positively in an awful degree.

  "'When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood, it
suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and emitted
from it a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of
smoke, and a noise that I can compare to nothing but thunder. As the
smoke cleared away, we saw one of the odd man-animals standing near
the head of the large beast with a trumpet in his hand, through
which (putting it to his mouth) he presently addressed us in loud,
harsh, and disagreeable accents, that, perhaps, we should have
mistaken for language, had they not come altogether through the nose.

  "'Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply, as I
could in no manner understand what was said; and in this difficulty
I turned to the porter, who was near swooning through affright, and
demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was, what
it wanted, and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed
upon its back. To this the porter replied, as well as he could for
trepidation, that he had once before heard of this sea-beast; that
it was a cruel demon, with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire,
created by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon
mankind; that the things upon its back were vermin, such as
sometimes infest cats and dogs, only a little larger and more
savage; and that these vermin had their uses, however evil- for,
through the torture they caused the beast by their nibbling and
stingings, it was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requisite
to make it roar and commit ill, and so fulfil the vengeful and
malicious designs of the wicked genii.

  "This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without once
even looking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the hills, while
the porter ran equally fast, although nearly in an opposite direction,
so that, by these means, he finally made his escape with my bundles,
of which I have no doubt he took excellent care- although this is a
point I cannot determine, as I do not remember that I ever beheld
him again.

  "'For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin
(who had come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon overtaken,
bound hand and foot, and conveyed to the beast, which immediately swam
out again into the middle of the sea.

  "'I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to
peril my life in such adventures as this; but regret being useless,
I made the best of my condition, and exerted myself to secure the
goodwill of the man-animal that owned the trumpet, and who appeared to
exercise authority over his fellows. I succeeded so well in this
endeavor that, in a few days, the creature bestowed upon me various
tokens of his favor, and in the end even went to the trouble of
teaching me the rudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its
language; so that, at length, I was enabled to converse with it
readily, and came to make it comprehend the ardent desire I had of
seeing the world.

  "'Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt
grumble, hiss, fiss, whiss,' said he to me, one day after dinner-
but I beg a thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your majesty is not
conversant with the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so the man-animals
were called; I presume because their language formed the connecting
link between that of the horse and that of the rooster). With your
permission, I will translate. 'Washish squashish,' and so forth:- that
is to say, 'I am happy to find, my dear Sinbad, that you are really
a very excellent fellow; we are now about doing a thing which is
called circumnavigating the globe; and since you are so desirous of
seeing the world, I will strain a point and give you a free passage
upon back of the beast.'"

  When the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the
"Isitsoornot," the king turned over from his left side to his right,
and said:

  "It is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you omitted,
hitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know I think
them exceedingly entertaining and strange?"

  The king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair
Scheherazade resumed her history in the following words:

  "Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative to the caliph-
'I thanked the man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very
much at home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the
ocean; although the surface of the latter is, in that part of the
world, by no means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we
went- so to say- either up hill or down hill all the time.'

  "That I think, was very singular," interrupted the king.

  "Nevertheless, it is quite true," replied Scheherazade.

  "I have my doubts," rejoined the king; "but, pray, be so good as
to go on with the story."

  "I will," said the queen. "'The beast,' continued Sinbad to the
caliph, 'swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at
length, we arrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in
circumference, but which, nevertheless, had been built in the middle
of the sea by a colony of little things like caterpillars'"*

  * The coralites.

  "Hum!" said the king.

  "'Leaving this island,' said Sinbad- (for Scheherazade, it must be
understood, took no notice of her husband's ill-mannered
ejaculation) 'leaving this island, we came to another where the
forests were of solid stone, and so hard that they shivered to
pieces the finest-tempered axes with which we endeavoured to cut
them down."'*

  * "One of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is a
petrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists of
several hundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to stone. Some
trees, now growing, are partly petrified. This is a startling fact for
natural philosophers, and must cause them to modify the existing
theory of petrification.- Kennedy.

  This account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated by
the discovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head waters
of the Cheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in the Black
Hills of the rocky chain.

  There is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the
globe more remarkable, either in a geological or picturesque point
of view than that presented by the petrified forest, near Cairo. The
traveller, having passed the tombs of the caliphs, just beyond the
gates of the city, proceeds to the southward, nearly at right angles
to the road across the desert to Suez, and after having travelled some
ten miles up a low barren valley, covered with sand, gravel, and sea
shells, fresh as if the tide had retired but yesterday, crosses a
low range of sandhills, which has for some distance run parallel to
his path. The scene now presented to him is beyond conception singular
and desolate. A mass of fragments of trees, all converted into
stone, and when struck by his horse's hoof ringing like cast iron,
is seen to extend itself for miles and miles around him, in the form
of a decayed and prostrate forest. The wood is of a dark brown hue,
but retains its form in perfection, the pieces being from one to
fifteen feet in length, and from half a foot to three feet in
thickness, strewed so closely together, as far as the eye can reach,
that an Egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way through amongst
them, and so natural that, were it in Scotland or Ireland, it might
pass without remark for some enormous drained bog, on which the
exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun. The roots and rudiments of the
branches are, in many cases, nearly perfect, and in some the
worm-holes eaten under the bark are readily recognizable. The most
delicate of the sap vessels, and all the finer portions of the
centre of the wood, are perfectly entire, and bear to be examined with
the strongest magnifiers. The whole are so thoroughly silicified as to
scratch glass and are capable of receiving the highest polish.-
Asiatic Magazine.

  "Hum!" said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no
attention, continued in the language of Sinbad.

  "'Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where
there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles
within the bowels of the earth, and that contained a greater number of
far more spacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in
all Damascus and Bagdad. From the roofs of these palaces there hung
myriads of gems, liked diamonds, but larger than men; and in among the
streets of towers and pyramids and temples, there flowed immense
rivers as black as ebony, and swarming with fish that had no eyes.'"*

  * The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.

  "Hum!" said the king.

 "'We then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty
mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted metal,
some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long*; while from
an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a quantity of ashes that the
sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens, and it became darker
than the darkest midnight; so that when we were even at the distance
of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain, it was impossible to
see the whitest object, however close we held it to our eyes.'"*(2)

  * In Iceland, 1783.

  *(2) "During the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kind
produced such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is more
than fifty leagues from the mountain, people could only find their way
by groping. During the eruption of Vesuvius, in 1794, at Caserta, four
leagues distant, people could only walk by the light of torches. On
the first of May, 1812, a cloud of volcanic ashes and sand, coming
from a volcano in the island of St. Vincent, covered the whole of
Barbadoes, spreading over it so intense a darkness that, at mid-day,
in the open air, one could not perceive the trees or other objects
near him, or even a white handkerchief placed at the distance of six
inches from the eye."- Murray, p. 215, Phil. edit.

  "Hum!" said the king.

  "'After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until we
met with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed- for
we here saw a great lake, at the bottom of which, more than a
hundred feet beneath the surface of the water, there flourished in
full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees.'"*

  * In the year 1790, in the Caraccas during an earthquake a portion
of the granite soil sank and left a lake eight hundred yards in
diameter, and from eighty to a hundred feet deep. It was a part of the
forest of Aripao which sank, and the trees remained green for
several months under the water."- Murray, p. 221

  "Hoo!" said the king.

  "Some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the
atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our own
does feather.'"*

  * The hardest steel ever manufactured may, under the action of a
blowpipe, be reduced to an impalpable powder, which will float readily
in the atmospheric air.

  "Fiddle de dee," said the king.

  "Proceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at the
most magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there meandered
a glorious river for several thousands of miles. This river was of
unspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than that of amber. It
was from three to six miles in width; and its banks which arose on
either side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height, were
crowned with ever-blossoming trees and perpetual sweet-scented
flowers, that made the whole territory one gorgeous garden; but the
name of this luxuriant land was the Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it
was inevitable death'"*

  * The region of the Niger. See Simmona's "Colonial Magazine."

  "Humph!" said the king.

  "'We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came to
another, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous
animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads. These
hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil, of a
funnel shape, and line the sides of them with, rocks, so disposed
one upon the other that they fall instantly, when trodden upon by
other animals, thus precipitating them into the monster's dens,
where their blood is immediately sucked, and their carcasses
afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an immense distance from
"the caverns of death."'"*

  * The Myrmeleon-lion-ant. The term "monster" is equally applicable
to small abnormal things and to great, while such epithets as "vast"
are merely comparative. The cavern of the myrmeleon is vast in
comparison with the hole of the common red ant. A grain of silex is
also a "rock."

  "Pooh!" said the king.

  "'Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with vegetables
that grew not upon any soil but in the air.* There were others that
sprang from the substance of other vegetables;*(2) others that derived
their substance from the bodies of living animals;*(3) and then again,
there were others that glowed all over with intense fire;*(4) others
that moved from place to place at pleasure,*(5) and what was still
more wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and
moved their limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable passion of
mankind for enslaving other creatures, and confining them in horrid
and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks.'"*(6)

  * The Epidendron, Flos Aeris, of the family of the Orchideae,
grows with merely the surface of its roots attached to a tree or other
object, from which it derives no nutriment- subsisting altogether upon
air.

  *(2) The Parasites, such as the wonderful Rafflesia Arnaldii.

  *(3) Schouw advocates a class of plants that grow upon living
animals- the Plantae Epizoae. Of this class are the Fuci and Algae.

  Mr. J. B. Williams, of Salem, Mass., presented the "National
Institute," with an insect from New Zealand, with the following
description:- "'The Hotte,' a decided caterpillar, or worm, is found
growing at the foot of the Rata tree, with a plant growing out of
its head. This most peculiar and most extraordinary insect travels
up both the Rata and Perriri trees, and entering into the top, eats
its way, perforating the trunk of the tree until it reaches the
root, it then comes out of the root, and dies, or remains dormant, and
the plant propagates out of its head; the body remains perfect and
entire, of a harder substance than when alive. From this insect the
natives making a coloring for tattooing."

  *(4) In mines and natural caves we find a species of cryptogamous
fungus that emits an intense phosphorescence.

  *(5) The orchis, scabius and valisneria.

  *(6) The corolla of this flower (Aristolochia Clematitis), which
is tubular, but terminating upwards in a ligulate limb, is inflated
into a globular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally
beset with stiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains
the pistil, which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together
with the surrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter than
the germen, cannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it upon the
stigma, as the flower stands always upright till after impregnation.
And hence, without some additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must
necessarily fan down to the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that
nature has furnished in this case, is that of the Tiputa
Pennicornis, a small insect, which entering the tube of the corrolla
in quest of honey, descends to the bottom, and rummages about till
it becomes quite covered with pollen; but not being able to force
its way out again, owing to the downward position of the hairs,
which converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap, and being
somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes backwards and
forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly traversing the
stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its impregnation, in
consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop, and the hairs to
shrink to the sides of the tube, effecting an easy passage for the
escape of the insect." Rev. P. Keith-System of Physiological Botany.

  "Pshaw!" said the king.

  "'Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the bees
and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition, that
they give daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise
men of the empire. The king of the place having offered a reward for
the solution of two very difficult problems, they were solved upon the
spot- the one by the bees, and the other by the birds; but the king
keeping their solution a secret, it was only after the most profound
researches and labor, and the writing of an infinity of big books,
during a long series of years, that the men-mathematicians at length
arrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the
spot by the bees and by the birds.'"*

  * The bees- ever since bees were- have been constructing their cells
with just such sides, in just such number, and at just such
inclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving
the profoundest mathematical principles) are the very sides, in the
very number, and at the very angles, which will afford the creatures
the most room that is compatible with the greatest stability of
structure.

  During the latter part of the last century, the question arose among
mathematicians- "to determine the best form that can be given to the
sails of a windmill, according to their varying distances from the
revolving vanes, and likewise from the centres of the revolution."
This is an excessively complex problem, for it is, in other words,
to find the best possible position at an infinity of varied distances,
and at an infinity of points on the arm. There were a thousand
futile attempts to answer the query on the part of the most
illustrious mathematicians; and when, at length, an undeniable
solution was discovered, men found that the wing of a bird had given
it with absolute precision ever since the first bird had traversed the
air.

  "Oh my!" said the king.

  "'We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found
ourselves close upon another, from whose shores there flew over our
heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth, and two hundred and forty
miles long; so that, although they flew a mile during every minute, it
required no less than four hours for the whole flock to pass over
us- in which there were several millions of millions of fowl.'"*

  * He observed a flock of pigeons passing betwixt Frankfort and the
Indian territory, one mile at least in breadth; it took up four
hours in passing, which, at the rate of one mile per minute, gives a
length of 240 miles; and, supposing three pigeons to each square yard,
gives 2,230,272,000 Pigeons.- "Travels in Canada and the United
States," by Lieut. F. Hall.

  "Oh fy!" said the king.

  "'No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us great
annoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of
another kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met
in my former voyages; for it was bigger than the biggest of the
domes on your seraglio, oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This
terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive, but was fashioned
entirely of belly, which was of a prodigious fatness and roundness, of
a soft-looking substance, smooth, shining and striped with various
colors. In its talons, the monster was bearing away to his eyrie in
the heavens, a house from which it had knocked off the roof, and in
the interior of which we distinctly saw human beings, who, beyond
doubt, were in a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which
awaited them. We shouted with all our might, in the hope of
frightening the bird into letting go of its prey, but it merely gave a
snort or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a
heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand!'"

  "Stuff!" said the king.

  "'It was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent
of immense extent and prodigious solidity, but which, nevertheless,
was supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no
fewer than four hundred horns.'"*

  * The earth is upheld by a cow of a blue color, having horns four
hundred in number."- Sale's Koran.

  "That, now, I believe," said the king, "because I have read
something of the kind before, in a book."

  "'We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in between
the legs of the cow, and, after some hours, found ourselves in a
wonderful country indeed, which, I was informed by the man-animal, was
his own native land, inhabited by things of his own species. This
elevated the man-animal very much in my esteem, and in fact, I now
began to feel ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which I had
treated him; for I found that the man-animals in general were a nation
of the most powerful magicians, who lived with worms in their
brain,* which, no doubt, served to stimulate them by their painful
writhings and wrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of
imagination!'"

  * "The Entozoa, or intestinal worms, have repeatedly been observed
in the muscles, and in the cerebral substance of men."- See Wyatt's
Physiology, p. 143.

  "Nonsense!" said the king.

  "'Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very
singular kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones were
iron and whose blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he had black
stones for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard a diet, he was
so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the
grandest temple in this city, at a rate surpassing that of the
flight of most birds.'"*

  * On the Great Western Railway, between London and Exeter, a speed
of 71 miles per hour has been attained. A train weighing 90 tons was
whirled from Paddington to Didcot (53 miles) in 51 minutes.

  "Twattle!" said the king.

  "'I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but bigger
than a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick; her
blood, like that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she was nearly
related,) was boiling water; and like him she ate nothing but wood
or black stones. This hen brought forth very frequently, a hundred
chickens in the day; and, after birth, they took up their residence
for several weeks within the stomach of their mother.'"*

  * The Eccalobeion

  "Fa! lal!" said the king.

  "'One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of
brass and wood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity
that he would have beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with the
exception of the great Caliph, Haroun Alraschid.* Another of these
magi constructed (of like material) a creature that put to shame
even the genius of him who made it; for so great were its reasoning
powers that, in a second, it performed calculations of so vast an
extent that they would have required the united labor of fifty
thousand fleshy men for a year.*(2) But a still more wonderful
conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thing that was neither man nor
beast, but which had brains of lead, intermixed with a black matter
like pitch, and fingers that it employed with such incredible speed
and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in writing out
twenty thousand copies of the Koran in an hour, and this with so
exquisite a precision, that in all the copies there should not be
found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair. This
thing was of prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrew
the mightiest empires at a breath; but its powers were exercised
equally for evil and for good.'"

  * Maelzel's Automaton Chess-player.

  "Ridiculous!" said the king.

  "'Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in
his veins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of
sitting down to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his dinner
was thoroughly roasted upon its floor.* Another had the faculty of
converting the common metals into gold, without even looking at them
during the process.*(2) Another had such a delicacy of touch that he
made a wire so fine as to be invisible.*(3) Another had such quickness
of perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elastic
body, while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of
nine hundred millions of times in a second.'"*(4)

  * Chabert, and since him, a hundred others.

  *(2) The Electrotype.

  *(3) Wollaston made of platinum for the field of views in a
telescope a wire one eighteen-thousandth part of an inch in thickness.
It could be seen only by means of the microscope.

  *(4) Newton demonstrated that the retina beneath the influence of
the violet ray of the spectrum, vibrated 900,000,000 of times in a
second.

  "Absurd!" said the king.

  "'Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody ever
yet saw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms,
kick out their legs, fight, or even get up and dance at his will.*
Another had cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could
have made himself heard from one end of the world to the other.*(2)
Another had so long an arm that he could sit down in Damascus and
indite a letter at Bagdad- or indeed at any distance whatsoever.*(3)
Another commanded the lightning to come down to him out of the
heavens, and it came at his call; and served him for a plaything
when it came. Another took two loud sounds and out of them made a
silence. Another constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant
lights.*(4) Another made ice in a red-hot furnace.*(5) Another
directed the sun to paint his portrait, and the sun did.*(6) Another
took this luminary with the moon and the planets, and having first
weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probed into their depths and
found out the solidity of the substance of which they were made. But
the whole nation is, indeed, of so surprising a necromantic ability,
that not even their infants, nor their commonest cats and dogs have
any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist at all, or that for
twenty millions of years before the birth of the nation itself had
been blotted out from the face of creation."'*(7)

  * Voltaic pile.

  *(3) The Electro telegraph transmits intelligence instantaneously-
at least at so far as regards any distance upon the earth.

  *(4) Common experiments in Natural Philosophy. If two red rays
from two luminous points be admitted into a dark chamber so as to fall
on a white surface, and differ in their length by 0.0000258 of an
inch, their intensity is doubled. So also if the difference in
length be any whole-number multiple of that fraction. A multiple by
2 1/4, 3 1/4, &c., gives an intensity equal to one ray only; but a
multiple by 2 1/2, 3 1/2, &c., gives the result of total darkness.
In violet rays similar effects arise when the difference in length
is 0.000157 of an inch; and with all other rays the results are the
same- the difference varying with a uniform increase from the violet
to the red.

  Analogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous results.

  *(5) Place a platina crucible over a spirit lamp, and keep it a
red heat; pour in some sulphuric acid, which, though the most volatile
of bodies at a common temperature, will be found to become
completely fixed in a hot crucible, and not a drop evaporates- being
surrounded by an atmosphere of its own, it does not, in fact, touch
the sides. A few drops of water are now introduced, when the acid,
immediately coming in contact with the heated sides of the crucible,
flies off in sulphurous acid vapor, and so rapid is its progress, that
the caloric of the water passes off with it, which falls a lump of ice
to the bottom; by taking advantage of the moment before it is
allowed to remelt, it may be turned out a lump of ice from a red-hot
vessel.

  *(6) The Daguerreotype.

  *(7) Although light travels 167,000 miles in a second, the
distance of 61 Cygni (the only star whose distance is ascertained)
is so inconceivably great, that its rays would require more than ten
years to reach the earth. For stars beyond this, 20- or even 1000
years- would be a moderate estimate. Thus, if they had been
annihilated 20, or 1000 years ago, we might still see them to-day by
the light which started from their surfaces 20 or 1000 years in the
past time. That many which we see daily are really extinct, is not
impossible- not even improbable.

  "Preposterous!" said the king.

  "'The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise
magi,'" continued Scheherazade, without being in any manner
disturbed by these frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on
the part of her husband- "'the wives and daughters of these eminent
conjurers are every thing that is accomplished and refined; and
would be every thing that is interesting and beautiful, but for an
unhappy fatality that besets them, and from which not even the
miraculous powers of their husbands and fathers has, hitherto, been
adequate to save. Some fatalities come in certain shapes, and some
in others- but this of which I speak has come in the shape of a
crotchet.'"

  "A what?" said the king.

  "'A crotchet'" said Scheherazade. "'One of the evil genii, who are
perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into the heads
of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as
personal beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the
region which lies not very far below the small of the back. Perfection
of loveliness, they say, is in the direct ratio of the extent of
this lump. Having been long possessed of this idea, and bolsters being
cheap in that country, the days have long gone by since it was
possible to distinguish a woman from a dromedary-'"

  "Stop!" said the king- "I can't stand that, and I won't. You have
already given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day, too, I
perceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been married?- my
conscience is getting to be troublesome again. And then that dromedary
touch- do you take me for a fool? Upon the whole, you might as well
get up and be throttled."

  These words, as I learn from the "Isitsoornot," both grieved and
astonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man of
scrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, she
submitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however, great
consolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from the
reflection that much of the history remained still untold, and that
the petulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most
righteous reward, in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.

                            THE END
