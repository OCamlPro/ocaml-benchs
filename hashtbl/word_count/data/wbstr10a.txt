*The Project Gutenberg Etext of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary*

*****This file should be named wbstr10a.txt or wbstr10a.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, wbstr11a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $4
million dollars per hour this year as we release some eight text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from $2 million.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

We need your donations more than ever!

tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Illinois Benedictine College (the "Project").  Among other

things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged

    A (named ? in the English, and most commonly  in other
languages). The first letter of the English and of many
other alphabets. The capital A of the alphabets of Middle
and Western Europe, as also the small letter (a), besides
the forms in Italic, black letter, etc., are all descended
from the old Latin A, which was borrowed from the Greek
Alpha, of the same form; and this was made from the first
letter (?) of the Phoenician alphabet, the equivalent of the
Hebrew Aleph, and itself from the Egyptian origin. The Aleph
was a consonant letter, with a guttural breath sound that
was not an element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks
took it to represent their vowel Alpha with the  sound, the
Phoenician alphabet having no vowel symbols.
    This letter, in English, is used for several different
vowel sounds. See Guide to pronunciation,  43P74. The
regular long a, as in fate, etc., is a comparatively modern
sound, and has taken the place of what, till about the early
part of the 17th century, was a sound of the quality of 
(as in far).
    2. (Mus.) The name of the sixth tone in the model major
scale (that in C), or the first tone of the minor scale,
which is named after it the scale in A minor. The second

between A and B.P A flat (A?) is the name of a tone
intermediate between A and G.

    A (? emph. ?). 1. [Shortened form of an. AS. ? one. See
One.] An adjective, commonly called the indefinite article,
and signifying one or any, but less emphatically. =At a
birth8; =In a word8; =At a blow8. Shak. It is placed before
nouns of the singular number denoting an individual object,
or a quality individualized, before collective nouns, and
also before plural nouns when the adjective few or the
phrase great many or good many is interposed; as, a dog, a
house, a man; a color; a sweetness; a hundred, a fleet, a
regiment; a few persons, a great many days. It is used for
an, for the sake of euphony, before words beginning with a
consonant sound [for exception of certain words beginning
with h, see An]; as, a table, a woman, a year, a unit, a
eulogy, a ewe, a oneness, such a one, etc. Formally an was
used both before vowels and consonants.
    2. [Originally the preposition a (an, on).] In each; to
or for each; as, =twenty leagues a day8, =a hundred pounds a
year8, =a dollar a yard8, etc.

    2. In process of; in the act of; into; to; P used with
verbal substantives in Ping which begin with a consonant.
This is a shortened form of the preposition an which was
used before the vowel sound); as in a hunting, a building, a
begging. =Jacob, when he was a dying8 Heb. xi. 21. =We'll a
birding together.8 = It was a doing.8 Shak. =He burst out a
laughing.8 Macaulay. The hyphen may be used to connect a
with the verbal substantive (as, aPhunting, aPbilding) or
the words may be written separately. This form of expression
is now for the most part obsolete, the a being omitted and
the verbal substantive treated as a participle.
    A. [From AS. of off, from. See Of.] Of. [Obs.] =The name
of John a Gaunt.8 =What time a day is it ?8 Shak. =It's six
a clock.8 B. Jonson.

    AP. A, as a prefix to English words, is derived from
various sources. (1) It frequently signifies on or in (from
an, a forms of AS. on), denoting a state, as in afoot, on
foot, abed, amiss, asleep, aground, aloft, away (AS. onweg),
and analogically, ablaze, atremble, etc. (2) AS. of off,
from, as in adown (AS. ofdne off the dun or hill). (3) AS.
? (Goth. usP, urP, Ger. erP), usually giving an intensive
force, and sometimes the sense of away, on, back, as in
arise, abide, ago. (4) Old English yP or iP (corrupted from
the AS. inseparable particle geP, cognate with OHG. gaP,
giP, Goth. gaP), which, as a prefix, made no essential
addition to the meaning, as in aware. (5) French  (L. ad
to), as in abase, achieve. (6) L. a, ab, abs, from, as in
avert. (7) Greek insep. prefix ? without, or privative, not,
as in abyss, atheist; akin to E. unP.
    Besides these, there are other sources from which the
prefix a takes its origin.
    A 1 (?). A registry mark given by underwriters (as at

    4. (Mar. Law) To relinquish all claim to; P used when an

    Syn.P To give up; yield; forego; cede; surrender;
resign; abdicate; quit; relinquish; renounce; desert;
forsake; leave; retire; withdraw from. P To Abandon, Desert,
Forsake. These words agree in representing a person as
giving up or leaving some object, but differ as to the mode
of doing it. The distinctive sense of abandon is that of
giving up a thing absolutely and finally; as, to abandon
one's friends, places, opinions, good or evil habits, a
hopeless enterprise, a shipwrecked vessel. Abandon is more
widely applicable than forsake or desert. The Latin
original of desert appears to have been originally applied
to the case of deserters from military service. Hence, the
verb, when used of persons in the active voice, has usually
or always a bad sense, implying some breach of fidelity,
honor, etc., the leaving of something which the person
should rightfully stand by and support; as, to desert one's
colors, to desert one's post, to desert one's principles or
duty. When used in the passive, the sense is not necessarily
bad; as, the fields were deserted, a deserted village,
deserted halls. Forsake implies the breaking off of previous
habit, association, personal connection, or that the thing
left had been familiar or frequented; as, to forsake old
friends, to forsake the paths of rectitude, the blood
forsook his cheeks. It may be used either in a good or in a
bad sense.
    AOban6don, n. [F. abandon. fr. abandonner. See Abandon,
v.] Abandonment; relinquishment. [Obs.]
    XA7ban7don6 (?), n. [F. See Abandon.] A complete giving
up to natural impulses; freedom from artificial constraint;
careless freedom or ease.
    AOban6doned (?), a. 1. Forsaken, deserted. =Your
abandoned streams.8
Thomson.
    2. SelfPabandoned, or given up to vice; extremely
wicked, or sinning without restraint; irreclaimably wicked ;
as, an abandoned villain.
    Syn.P Profligate; dissolute; corrupt; vicious; depraved;
reprobate; wicked; unprincipled; graceless; vile. P
Abandoned, Profligate, Reprobate. These adjectives agree in
expressing the idea of great personal depravity. Profligate
has reference to open and shameless immoralities, either in

    Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased.
Luke xiv.ll.
    Syn.P To Abase, Debase, Degrade. These words agree in
the idea of bringing down from a higher to a lower state.
Abase has reference to a bringing down in condition or
feelings; as to abase one's self before God. Debase has
reference to the bringing down of a thing in purity, or
making it base. It is, therefore, always used in a bad
sense, as, to debase the coin of the kingdom, to debase the
mind by vicious indulgence, to debase one's style by coarse
or vulgar expressions. Degrade has reference to a bringing
down from some higher grade or from some standard. Thus, a
priest is degraded from the clerical office. When used in a
moral sense, it denotes a bringing down in character and
just estimation; as, degraded by intemperance, a degrading
employment, etc. =Art is degraded when it is regarded only
as a trade.8
    AObased6 (?), a. 1. Lowered; humbled.

F. bahir, to astonish, fr. L. ex + the interjection bah,
expressing astonishment. In OE. somewhat confused with
abase. Cf. Finish.] To destroy the selfPpossession of; to
confuse or confound, as by exciting suddenly a consciousness
of guilt, mistake, or inferiority; to put to shame; to
disconcert; to discomfit.
    Abashed, the devil stood,
    And felt how awful goodness is.
Milton.
    He was a man whom no check could abash.
Macaulay.
    Syn.P To confuse; confound; disconcert; shame. P To
Abash, Confuse, Confound. Abash is a stronger word than
confuse, but not so strong as confound. We are abashed when
struck either with sudden shame or with a humbling sense of
inferiority; as, Peter was abashed in the presence of those
who are greatly his superiors. We are confused when, from
some unexpected or startling occurrence, we lose clearness
of thought and selfPpossession. Thus, a witness is often
confused by a severe crossPexamination; a timid person is
apt to be confused in entering a room full of strangers. We
are confounded when our minds are overwhelmed, as it were,
by something wholly unexpected, amazing, dreadful, etc., so
that we have nothing to say. Thus, a criminal is usually
confounded at the discovery of his guilt.
    Satan stood
    Awhile as mute, confounded what to say.
Milton.

Abating.] [OF. abatre to beat down, F. abattre, LL. abatere;
ab or ad + batere, battere (popular form for L. batuere to
beat). Cf. Bate, Batter.]

    2. To bring down or reduce from a higher to a lower
state, number, or degree; to lessen; to diminish; to

(Eng. Law) To diminish; to reduce. Legacies are liable to be
abated entirely or in proportion, upon a deficiency of
assets.
    To abate a tax, to remit it either wholly or in part.
    AObate6 (?), v.i. [See Abate, v.t.] 1. To decrease, or
become less in strength or violence; as, pain abates, a
storm abates.
    The fury of Glengarry ... rapidly abated.
Macaulay.
    2. To be defeated, or come to naught; to fall through;
to fail; as, a writ abates.
    To abate into a freehold, To abate in lands (Law), to
enter into a freehold after the death of the last possessor,
and before the heir takes possession. See Abatement, 4.
    Syn.P To subside; decrease; intermit; decline; diminish;
lessen. P To Abate, Subside. These words, as here compared,
imply a coming down from some previously raised or exited
state. Abate expresses this in respect to degrees, and
implies a diminution of force or of intensity; as, the storm
abates, the cold abates, the force of the wind abates; or,
the wind abates, a fever abates. Subside (to settle down)
has reference to a previous state of agitation or commotion;
as, the waves subside after a storm, the wind subsides into
a calm. When the words are used figuratively, the same
distinction should be observed. If we conceive of a thing as
having different degrees of intensity or strength, the word
to be used is abate. Thus we say, a man's anger abates, the
ardor of one's love abates, =Winter rage abates8. But if the
image be that of a sinking down into quiet from preceding
excitement or commotion, the word to be used is subside; as,
the tumult of the people subsides, the public mind subsided
into a calm. The same is the case with those emotions which
are tumultuous in their nature; as, his passion subsides,
his joy quickly subsided, his grief subsided into a pleasing
melancholy. Yet if, in such cases, we were thinking of the
degree of violence of the emotion, we might use abate; as,
his joy will abate in the progress of time; and so in other
instances.

Macaulay.
Syn. P Capacity; talent; cleverness; faculty; capability;
efficiency; aptitude; aptness; address; dexterity; skill.
Ability, Capacity. These words come into comparison when
applied to the higher intellectual powers. Ability has
reference to the active exercise of our faculties. It
implies not only native vigor of mind, but that ease and
promptitude of execution which arise from mental training.
Thus, we speak of the ability with which a book is written,
an argument maintained, a negotiation carried on, etc. It
always something to be done, and the power of doing it.
Capacity has reference to the receptive powers. In its
higher exercises it supposes great quickness of apprehension
and breadth of intellect, with an uncommon aptitude for
acquiring and retaining knowledge. Hence it carries with it
the idea of resources and undeveloped power. Thus we speak
of the extraordinary capacity of such men as Lord Bacon,
Blaise Pascal, and Edmund Burke. =Capacity,8 says H. Taylor,
=is requisite to devise, and ability to execute, a great
enterprise.8 The word abilities, in the plural, embraces
both these qualities, and denotes high mental endowments.

Syn. P To Abolish, Repeal, Abrogate, Revoke, Annul, Nullify,
Cancel. These words have in common the idea of setting aside
by some overruling act. Abolish applies particularly to
things of a permanent nature, such as institutions, usages,
customs, etc.; as, to abolish monopolies, serfdom, slavery.
Repeal describes the act by which the legislature of a state
sets aside a law which it had previously enacted. Abrogate
was originally applied to the repeal of a law by the Roman
people; and hence, when the power of making laws was usurped
by the emperors, the term was applied to their act of
setting aside the laws. Thus it came to express that act by
which a sovereign or an executive government sets aside
laws, ordinances, regulations, treaties, conventions, etc.
Revoke denotes the act or recalling some previous grant
which conferred, privilege, etc.; as, to revoke a decree, to
revoke a power of attorney, a promise, etc. Thus, also, we
speak of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Annul is
used in a more general sense, denoting simply to make void;
as, to annul a contract, to annul an agreement. Nullify is
an old word revived in this country, and applied to the
setting of things aside either by force or by total
disregard; as, to nullify an act of Congress. Cancel is to
strike out or annul, by a deliberate exercise of power,
something which has operative force.

abscissa of the point is the distance cut off from the axis
of X by a line drawn through it and parallel to the axis of
Y. When a point in space is referred to three axes having a
common intersection, the abscissa may be the distance
measured parallel to either of them, from the point to the
plane of the other two axes. Abscissas and ordinates taken
together are called cordinates. P OX or PY is the abscissa
of the point P of the curve, OY or PX its ordinate, the
intersecting lines OX and OY being the axes of abscissas and
ordinates respectively, and the point O their origin.

Syn. P To Absorb, Engross, Swallow up, Engulf. These words
agree in one general idea, that of completely taking up.
They are chiefly used in a figurative sense and may be
distinguished by a reference to their etymology. We speak of
a person as absorbed (lit., drawn in, swallowed up) in study
or some other employment of the highest interest. We speak
of a person as ebgrossed (lit., seized upon in the gross, or
wholly) by something which occupies his whole time and
thoughts, as the acquisition of wealth, or the attainment of
honor. We speak of a person (under a stronger image) as
swallowed up and lost in that which completely occupies his
thoughts and feelings, as in grief at the death of a
friend, or in the multiplied cares of life. We speak of a
person as engulfed in that which (like a gulf) takes in all
his hopes and interests; as, engulfed in misery, ruin, etc.

mind P the marriage of the clergy.

as casual, when it falls out or happens, as it were, by mere

applied to what occurs without any known cause, and in
opposition to what has been foreseen; as, a fortuitous
concourse of atoms. We call a thing contingent when it is
such that, considered in itself, it may or may not happen,
but is dependent for its existence on something else; as,

distinctive properties of alkalies or bases, combining with
them to form salts, at the same time losing their own
peculiar properties. They all contain hydrogen, united with
a more negative element or radical, either alone, or more
generally with oxygen, and take their names from this
negative element or radical. Those which contain no oxygen
are sometimes called hydracids in distinction from the
others which are called oxygen acids or oxacids.

the place of oxygen, and the corresponding compounds are
called respectively sulphur acids or sulphacids, selenium
acids, or tellurium acids. When the hydrogen of an acid is
replaced by a positive element or radical, a salt is formed,
and hence acids are sometimes named as salts of hydrogen; as
hydrogen nitrate for nitric acid, hydrogen sulphate for
sulphuric acid, etc. In the old chemistry the name acid was
applied to the oxides of the negative or nonmetallic
elements, now sometimes called anhydrides.

etc.  =No admittance.8 Its secondary or moral sense, as
=admittance   to the church,8 is almost entirely laid aside.
Admission has taken to itself the secondary or figurative
senses; as, admission to the rights of citizenship;
admission to the church; the admissions made by one of the
parties in a dispute. And even when used in its primary
sense, it is not identical with admittance. Thus, we speak
of admission into a country, territory, and other larger
localities, etc., where admittance could not be used. So,
when we speak of admission to a concert or other public
assembly, the meaning is not perhaps exactly that of
admittance, viz., access within the walls of the building,
but rather a reception into the audience, or access to the
performances. But the lines of distinction on this subject
are one definitely drawn.

act of a superior. It is authoritative fault-finding or

attractive.
As a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
Isa. lxi. 10.
At church, with meek and unaffected grace,
His looks adorned the venerable place.
Goldsmith.
Syn. - To deck; decorate; embellish; ornament; beautify;
grace; dignify; exalt; honor. - To Adorn, Ornament,
Decorate, Embellish. We decorate and ornament by putting on
some adjunct which is attractive or beautiful, and which
serves to heighten the general effect. Thus, a lady's
head-dress may be ornament or decorated with flowers or
jewelry; a hall may be decorated or ornament with carving or
gilding, with wreaths of flowers, or with hangings.
Ornament is used in a wider sense than decorate. To
embellish is to beautify or ornament richly, not so much by
mere additions or details as by modifying the thing itself
as a whole. It sometimes means gaudy and artificial
decoration. We embellish a book with rich engravings; a
style is embellished with rich and beautiful imagery; a
shopkeeper embellishes his front window to attract
attention. Adorn is sometimes identical with decorate, as
when we say, a lady was adorned with jewels. In other cases,
it seems to imply something more. Thus, we speak of a
gallery of paintings as adorned with the works of some of
the great masters, or adorned with noble statuary and
columns. Here decorated and ornamented would hardly be
appropriate. There is a value in these works of genius
beyond mere show and ornament. Adorn may be used of what is
purely moral; as, a character adorned with every Christian
grace. Here neither decorate, nor ornament, nor embellish is
proper.

Syn. P Calamity; sorrow; distress; grief; pain; adversity;

Affliction, Sorrow, Grief, Distress. Affliction and sorrow
are terms of wide and general application; grief and
distress have reference to particular cases. Affliction is
the stronger term. The suffering lies deeper in the soul,
and usually arises from some powerful cause, such as the
loss of what is most dear P friends, health, etc. We do not
speak of mere sickness or pain as =an affliction,8 though
one who suffers from either is said to be afflicted; but
deprivations of every kind, such as deafness, blindness,
loss of limbs, etc., are called afflictions, showing that
term applies particularly to prolonged sources of
suffering. Sorrow and grief are much alike in meaning, but
grief is the stronger term of the two, usually denoting
poignant mental suffering for some definite cause, as, grief
for the death of a dear friend; sorrow is more reflective,
and is tinged with regret, as, the misconduct of a child is
looked upon with sorrow. Grief is often violent and
demonstrative; sorrow deep and brooding. Distress implies
extreme suffering, either bodily or mental. In its higher
stages, it denotes pain of a restless, agitating kind, and
almost always supposes some struggle of mind or body.
Affliction is allayed, grief subsides, sorrow is soothed,
distress is mitigated.

Alarm, Fright, Terror, Consternation. These words express
different degrees of fear at the approach of danger. Fright
is fear suddenly excited, producing confusion of the senses,
and hence it is unreflecting. Alarm is the hurried agitation
of feeling which springs from a sense of immediate and
extreme exposure. Terror is agitating and excessive fear,
which usually benumbs the faculties. Consternation is
overwhelming fear, and carries a notion of powerlessness and
amazement. Alarm agitates the feelings; terror disorders the
understanding and affects the will; fright seizes on and
confuses the sense; consternation takes possession of the
soul, and subdues its faculties. See Apprehension.

Northumbrian alle, akin to D. & OHG. al, Ger. all, Icel.
allr. Dan. al, Sw. all, Goth. alls; and perh. to Ir. and
Gael. uile, W. oll.] 1. The whole quantity, extent,
duration, amount, quality, or degree of; the whole; the
whole number of; any whatever; every; as, all the wheat; all
the land; all the year; all the strength; all happiness; all
abundance; loss of all power; beyond all doubt; you will see
us all (or all of us).
Prove all things: hold fast that which is good.
1 Thess. v. 21.
2. Any. [Obs.] =Without all remedy.8
Shak.
5 When the definite article =the,8 or a possessive or a
demonstrative pronoun, is joined to the noun that all
qualifies, all precedes the article or the pronoun; as, all
the cattle; all my labor; all his wealth; all our families;
all your citizens; all their property; all other joys.
This word, not only in popular language, but in the
Scriptures, often signifies, indefinitely, a large portion
or number, or a great part. Thus, all the cattle in Egypt
died, all Judea and all the region round about Jordan, all
men held John as a prophet, are not to be understood in a
literal sense, but as including a large part, or very great
numbers.

becomes intensive.
2. Even; just. (Often a mere intensive adjunct.) [Obs. or
Poet.]
All as his straying flock he fed.
Spenser.
A damsel lay deploring
All on a rock reclined.
Gay.
All to, or AllPto. In such phrases as =all to rent,8 all to
break,8 =allPto frozen,8 etc., which are of frequent
occurrence in our old authors, the all and the to have
commonly been regarded as forming a compound adverb,
equivalent in meaning to entirely, completely, altogether.
But the sense of entireness lies wholly in the word all (as
it does in =all forlorn,8 and similar expressions), and the
to properly belongs to the following word, being a kind of
intensive prefix (orig. meaning asunder and answering to the
LG. terO, HG. zerO). It is frequently to be met with in old
books, used without the all. Thus Wyclif says, =The vail of
the temple was to rent:8 and of Judas, =He was hanged and
toPburst the middle:8 i. e., burst in two, or asunder. P All
along. See under Along. P All and some, individually and

Arnold. P See also under All, n.
 All (?), n. The whole number, quantity, or amount; the
entire thing; everything included or concerned; the
aggregate; the whole; totality; everything or every person;
as, our all is at stake.

Shak.
All that thou seest is mine.
Gen. xxxi. 43.
All is used with of, like a partitive; as, all of a thing,
all of us.
After all, after considering everything to the contrary;
nevertheless. P All in all, a phrase which signifies all
things to a person, or everything desired; (also
adverbially) wholly; altogether.
Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee,
Forever.

All told, all counted; in all. P And all, and the rest; and

all. (a) In every respect; wholly; thoroughly. [Obs.] =She
is a shrew at al(l).8 Chaucer. (b) A phrase much used by way
of enforcement or emphasis, usually in negative or
interrogative sentences, and signifying in any way or
respect; in the least degree or to the least extent; in the
least; under any circumstances; as, he has no ambition at
all; has he any property at all? =Nothing at all.8 Shak. =It
thy father at all miss me.8 1 Sam. xx. 6. P Over ~,
everywhere. [Obs.] Chaucer.
5 All is much used in composition to enlarge the meaning, or
add force to a word. In some instances, it is completely
incorporated into words, and its final consonant is dropped,
as in almighty, already, always: but, in most instances, it
is an adverb prefixed to adjectives or participles, but
usually with a hyphen, as, allPbountiful, allPglorious,
allimportant, allPsurrounding, etc. In others it is an
adjective; as, allpower, allPgiver. Anciently many words,
as, alabout, alaground, etc., were compounded with all,
which are now written separately.
All, conj. [Orig. all, adv., wholly: used with though or if,
which being dropped before the subjunctive left all as if in
the sense although.] Although; albeit. [Obs.]
All they were wondrous loth.

form of government, and, in a republic, we generally speak
of allegiance to the government, to the state, etc. In well
conducted monarchies, loyalty is a warmPhearted feeling of
fidelity and obedience to the sovereign. It is personal in
its nature; and hence we speak of the loyalty of a wife to
her husband, not of her allegiance. In cases where we
personify, loyalty is more commonly the word used; as,
loyalty to the constitution; loyalty to the cause of virtue;
loyalty to truth and religion, etc.

figure of Peace and Victory crowning some historical
personage is an allegory. =I am the Vine, ye are the
branches8 [John xv. 1P6] is a spoken allegory. In the
parable there is no transference of properties. The parable
of the sower [Matt. xiii. 3P23] represents all things as
according to their proper nature. In the allegory quoted
above the properties of the vine and the relation of the
branches are transferred to the person of Christ and Hi?

perfect; as, to amend our ways, to amend a text, the draft
of a bill, etc. Emend is only another form of amend, and is
applied chiefly to editions of books, etc. To reform is

Syn. P Amidst, Among. These words differ to some extent from

as, this work was written amidst many interruptions. Among

ancients, among the thickest of trees, among these

amidst are commonly used when the idea of separate or
distinguishable objects is not prominent. Hence, we say,
they kept on amidst the storm, amidst the gloom, he was
sinking amidst the waves, he persevered amidst many
difficulties; in none of which cases could among be used. In
like manner, Milton speaks of Abdiel, P
The seraph Abdiel, faithful found;
Among the faithless faithful only he,
because he was then considered as one of the angels. But
when the poet adds, P
From amidst them forth he passed,
we have rather the idea of the angels as a collective body.

Syn. - Old; primitive; pristine; antique; antiquated;
oldPfashioned; obsolete. P Ancient, Antiquated, Obsolete,
Antique, Antic, Old. P Ancient is opposed to modern, and has
antiquity; as, an ancient family, ancient landmarks, ancient
institutions, systems of thought, etc. Antiquated describes
that which has gone out of use or fashion; as, antiquated
furniture, antiquated laws, rules, etc. Obsolete is commonly
used, instead of antiquated, in reference to language,
customs, etc.; as, an obsolete word or phrase, an obsolete
expression. Antique is applied, in present usage, either to
that which has come down from the ancients; as, an antique
cameo, bust, etc.; or to that which is made to imitate some
~ work of art; as, an antique temple. In the days of
Shakespeare, antique was often used for ancient; as, =an
antique song,8 =an antique Roman;8 and hence, from
singularity often attached to what is ~, it was used in the
sense of grotesque; as, =an oak whose antique root peeps
out; 8 and hence came our present word antic, denoting
grotesque or ridiculous. We usually apply both ancient and
old to things subject to gradual decay. We say, an old man,
an ancient record; but never, the old stars, an old river or
mountain. In general, however, ancient is opposed to modern,
and old to new, fresh, or recent. When we speak of a thing
that existed formerly, which has ceased to exist, we
commonly use ancient; as, ancient republics, ancient heroes;
and not old republics, old heroes. But when the thing which
began or existed in former times is still in existence, we
use either ancient or old; as, ancient statues or
paintings, or old statues or paintings; ancient authors, or
old authors, meaning books.

Shak.
Syn. - Resentment; wrath; rage; fury; passion; ire gall;
choler; indignation; displeasure; vexation; grudge; spleen.
P Anger, Indignation, Resentment, Wrath, Ire, Rage, Fury.
Anger is a feeling of keen displeasure (usually with a
desire to punish) for what we regard as wrong toward
ourselves or others. It may be excessive or misplaced, but
is not necessarily criminal. Indignation is a generous
outburst of ~ in view of things which are indigna, or
unworthy to be done, involving what is mean, cruel,
flagitious, etc., in character or conduct. Resentment is
often a moody feeling, leading one to brood over his
supposed personal wrongs with a deep and lasting ~. See
Resentment. Wrath and ire (the last poetical) express the
feelings of one who is bitterly provoked. Rage is a vehement
ebullition of ~; and fury is an excess of rage, amounting
almost to madness. Warmth of constitution often gives rise
to anger; a high sense of honor creates indignation at
crime; a man of quick sensibilities is apt to cherish
resentment; the wrath and ire of men are often connected
with a haughty and vindictive spirit; rage and fury are
distempers of the soul to be regarded only with abhorrence.

To Anticipate, Expect. These words, as here compared, agree
in regarding some future event as about to take place.
Expect is the stringer. It supposes some ground or reason in
the mind for considering the event as likely to happen.

denotes simply to take into the mind as conception of the
future. Hence, to say, =I did not anticipate a refusal,8
expresses something less definite and strong than to say, =
did not expect it.8 Still, anticipate is a convenient word
to be interchanged with expect in cases where the thought
will allow.

Syn. - Excuse. An apology, in the original sense of the
word, was a pleading off from some charge or imputation, by
explaining and defending one's principles or conduct. It
therefore amounted to a vindication. One who offers an
apology, admits himself to have been, at least apparently,
in the wrong, but brings forward some palliating
circumstance, or tenders a frank acknowledgment, by way of
reparation. We make an apology for some breach of propriety
or decorum (like rude expressions, unbecoming conduct,
etc.), or some deficiency in what might be reasonably
expected. We offer an excuse when we have been guilty of
some breach or neglect of duty; and we do it by way of
extenuating our fault, and with a view to be forgiven. When
an excuse has been accepted, an apology may still, in some
cases, be necessary or appropriate. =An excuse is not
grounded on the claim of innocence, but is rather an appeal
for favor resting on some collateral circumstance. An
apology mostly respects the conduct of individuals toward
each other as equals; it is a voluntary act produced by
feelings of decorum, or a desire for the good opinion of
others.8

Syn. - To Appreciate, Estimate, Esteem. Estimate is an act
of judgment; esteem is an act of valuing or prizing, and
when applied to individuals, denotes a sentiment of moral
approbation. See Estimate. Appreciate lies between the two.
As compared with estimate, it supposes a union of
sensibility with judgment, producing a nice and delicate
perception. As compared with esteem, it denotes a valuation
of things according to their appropriate and distinctive
excellence, and not simply their moral worth. Thus, with
reference to the former of these (delicate perception), an
able writer says. =Women have a truer appreciation of
character than men;8 and another remarks, =It is difficult
to appreciate the true force and distinctive sense of terms
which we are every day using.8 So, also, we speak of the
difference between two things, as sometimes hardly
appreciable. With reference to the latter of these (that of
valuation as the result of a nice perception), we say, =It
requires a pe??liar cast of character to appreciate the
poetry of Wordsworth;8 =He who has no delicacy himself, can 
not appreciate it in others;8 =The thought of death is
salutary, because it leads us to appreciate worldly things
aright.8 Appreciate is much used in cases where something is
in danger of being overlooked or undervalued; as when we
speak of appreciating the difficulties of a subject, or the
risk of an undertaking. So Lord Plunket, referring to an
=ominous silence8 which prevailed among the Irish
peasantry, says, =If you knew now to appreciate that
silence, it is more formidable than the most clamorous
opposition.8 In like manner, a person who asks some favor of
another is apt to say, =I trust you will appreciate my
motives in this request.8 Here we have the key to a very
frequent use of the word. It is hardly necessary to say that
appreciate looks on the favorable side of things. we never
speak of appreciating a man's faults, but his merits. This
idea of regarding things favorably appears more fully in the
word appreciative; as when we speak of an appreciative
audience, or an appreciative review, meaning one that
manifests a quick perception and a ready valuation of
excellence.

common the sense of circulating reports to a man's injury

slander or calumniate by spreading injurious reports which

consent of the will or feelings. We assent to the views of
others when our minds come to the same conclusion with
theirs as to what is true, right, or admissible. We consent
when there is such a concurrence of our will with their
desires and wishes that we decide to comply with their
requests. The king of England gives his assent, not his
consent, to acts of Parliament, because, in theory at least,
he is not governed by personal feelings or choice, but by a
deliberate, judgment as to the common good. We also use
assent in cases where a proposal is made which involves but
little interest or feeling. A lady may assent to a
gentleman's opening the window; but if he offers himself in
marriage, he must wait for her consent.

suit, it is most generally applied to the taking of
property, whether at common law, as a species of distress,
to compel defendant's appearance, or under local statutes,
to satisfy the judgment the plaintiff may recover in the
action. The terms attachment and arrest are both applied to
the taking or apprehension of a defendant to compel an
appearance in a civil action. Attachment are issued at
common law and is chancery, against persons for contempt of
court. In England, attachment is employed in some cases
where capias is with us, as against a witness who fails to
appear on summons. In some of the New England States a writ
of attachment is a species of mesne process upon which the
property of a defendant may be saized at the commencement of
a suit and before summons to him, and may be held to satisfy
the judgment the plaintiff may recover. In other States this
writ can issue only against absconding debtors and those who
conceal themselves. See Foreign, Garnishment, Truster
process.
Bouvier. Burrill. Blackstone. 
Syn. - Attachment, Affection. The leading idea of affection
is that of warmth and tenderness; the leading idea of
attachment is that of being bound to some object by strong
and lasting ties. There is more of sentiment (and sometimes
of romance) in affection, and more of principle in
preserving attachment. We speak of the ardor of the one, and
the fidelity of the other. There is another distinction in
the use and application of these words. The term attachment
is applied to a wider range of objects than affection. A man
may have a strong attachment to his country, to his
profession, to his principles, and even to favorite places;
in respect to none of these could we use the word affection.

Syn. - To Attack, Assail, Assault, Invade. These words all
denote a violent onset; attack being the generic term, and
the others specific forms of attack. To attack is to
commence the onset; to assail is to make a sudden and
violent ~, or to make repeated attacks; to assault
(literally, to leap upon) is to ~ physically by a

Thus, a person may attack by offering violence of any kind;
he may assail by means of missile weapons; he may assault by
direct personal violence; a king may invade by marching an
army into a country. Figuratively, we may say, men attack
with argument or satire; they assail with abuse or
reproaches; they may be assaulted by severe temptations; the
rights of the people may be invaded by the encroachments of
the crown.

inheritance, nor could he sue or testify in any court, or
claim any legal protection or rights. In England attainders
are now abolished, and in the United States the Constitution

Syn. - Attitude, Posture. Both of these words describe the
visible disposition of the limbs. Posture relates to their
position merely; attitude refers to their fitness for some
specific object. The object of an attitude is to set forth
exhibit some internal feeling; as, attitude of wonder, of
admiration, of grief, etc. It is, therefore, essentially and
designedly expressive. Its object is the same with that of
gesture; viz., to hold forth and represent. Posture has no
such design. If we speak of posture in prayer, or the
posture of devotion, it is only the natural disposition of
the limbs, without any intention to show forth or exhibit.
