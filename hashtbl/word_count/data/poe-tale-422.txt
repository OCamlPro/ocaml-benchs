                         A TALE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS

                               by Edgar Allan Poe

  DURING the fall of the year 1827, while residing near
Charlottesville, Virginia, I casually made the acquaintance of Mr.
Augustus Bedloe. This young gentleman was remarkable in every respect,
and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity. I found it
impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his physical
relations. Of his family I could obtain no satisfactory account.
Whence he came, I never ascertained. Even about his age- although I
call him a young gentleman- there was something which perplexed me
in no little degree. He certainly seemed young- and he made a point of
speaking about his youth- yet there were moments when I should have
had little trouble in imagining him a hundred years of age. But in
no regard was he more peculiar than in his personal appearance. He was
singularly tall and thin. He stooped much. His limbs were
exceedingly long and emaciated. His forehead was broad and low. His
complexion was absolutely bloodless. His mouth was large and flexible,
and his teeth were more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever
before seen teeth in a human head. The expression of his smile,
however, was by no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it
had no variation whatever. It was one of profound melancholy- of a
phaseless and unceasing gloom. His eyes were abnormally large, and
round like those of a cat. The pupils, too, upon any accession or
diminution of light, underwent contraction or dilation, just such as
is observed in the feline tribe. In moments of excitement the orbs
grew bright to a degree almost inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous
rays, not of a reflected but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a
candle or the sun; yet their ordinary condition was so totally
vapid, filmy, and dull as to convey the idea of the eyes of a
long-interred corpse.

  These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much
annoyance, and he was continually alluding to them in a sort of half
explanatory, half apologetic strain, which, when I first heard it,
impressed me very painfully. I soon, however, grew accustomed to it,
and my uneasiness wore off. It seemed to be his design rather to
insinuate than directly to assert that, physically, he had not
always been what he was- that a long series of neuralgic attacks had
reduced him from a condition of more than usual personal beauty, to
that which I saw. For many years past he had been attended by a
physician, named Templeton- an old gentleman, perhaps seventy years of
age- whom he had first encountered at Saratoga, and from whose
attention, while there, he either received, or fancied that he
received, great benefit. The result was that Bedloe, who was
wealthy, had made an arrangement with Dr. Templeton, by which the
latter, in consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had
consented to devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the
care of the invalid.

  Doctor Templeton had been a traveller in his younger days, and at
Paris had become a convert, in great measure, to the doctrines of
Mesmer. It was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he had
succeeded in alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and this
success had very naturally inspired the latter with a certain degree
of confidence in the opinions from which the remedies had been educed.
The Doctor, however, like all enthusiasts, had struggled hard to
make a thorough convert of his pupil, and finally so far gained his
point as to induce the sufferer to submit to numerous experiments.
By a frequent repetition of these, a result had arisen, which of
late days has become so common as to attract little or no attention,
but which, at the period of which I write, had very rarely been
known in America. I mean to say, that between Doctor Templeton and
Bedloe there had grown up, little by little, a very distinct and
strongly marked rapport, or magnetic relation. I am not prepared to
assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond the limits of the
simple sleep-producing power, but this power itself had attained great
intensity. At the first attempt to induce the magnetic somnolency, the
mesmerist entirely failed. In the fifth or sixth he succeeded very
partially, and after long continued effort. Only at the twelfth was
the triumph complete. After this the will of the patient succumbed
rapidly to that of the physician, so that, when I first became
acquainted with the two, sleep was brought about almost
instantaneously by the mere volition of the operator, even when the
invalid was unaware of his presence. It is only now, in the year 1845,
when similar miracles are witnessed daily by thousands, that I dare
venture to record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious
fact.

  The temperature of Bedloe was, in the highest degree sensitive,
excitable, enthusiastic. His imagination was singularly vigorous and
creative; and no doubt it derived additional force from the habitual
use of morphine, which he swallowed in great quantity, and without
which he would have found it impossible to exist. It was his
practice to take a very large dose of it immediately after breakfast
each morning- or, rather, immediately after a cup of strong coffee,
for he ate nothing in the forenoon- and then set forth alone, or
attended only by a dog, upon a long ramble among the chain of wild and
dreary hills that lie westward and southward of Charlottesville, and
are there dignified by the title of the Ragged Mountains.

  Upon a dim, warm, misty day, toward the close of November, and
during the strange interregnum of the seasons which in America is
termed the Indian Summer, Mr. Bedloe departed as usual for the
hills. The day passed, and still he did not return.

  About eight o'clock at night, having become seriously alarmed at his
protracted absence, we were about setting out in search of him, when
he unexpectedly made his appearance, in health no worse than usual,
and in rather more than ordinary spirits. The account which he gave of
his expedition, and of the events which had detained him, was a
singular one indeed.

  "You will remember," said he, "that it was about nine in the morning
when I left Charlottesville. I bent my steps immediately to the
mountains, and, about ten, entered a gorge which was entirely new to
me. I followed the windings of this pass with much interest. The
scenery which presented itself on all sides, although scarcely
entitled to be called grand, had about it an indescribable and to me a
delicious aspect of dreary desolation. The solitude seemed
absolutely virgin. I could not help believing that the green sods
and the gray rocks upon which I trod had been trodden never before
by the foot of a human being. So entirely secluded, and in fact
inaccessible, except through a series of accidents, is the entrance of
the ravine, that it is by no means impossible that I was indeed the
first adventurer- the very first and sole adventurer who had ever
penetrated its recesses.

  "The thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distinguishes the
Indian Summer, and which now hung heavily over all objects, served, no
doubt, to deepen the vague impressions which these objects created. So
dense was this pleasant fog that I could at no time see more than a
dozen yards of the path before me. This path was excessively
sinuous, and as the sun could not be seen, I soon lost all idea of the
direction in which I journeyed. In the meantime the morphine had its
customary effect- that of enduing all the external world with an
intensity of interest. In the quivering of a leaf- in the hue of a
blade of grass- in the shape of a trefoil- in the humming of a bee- in
the gleaming of a dew-drop- in the breathing of the wind- in the faint
odors that came from the forest- there came a whole universe of
suggestion- a gay and motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical
thought.

  "Busied in this, I walked on for several hours, during which the
mist deepened around me to so great an extent that at length I was
reduced to an absolute groping of the way. And now an indescribable
uneasiness possessed me- a species of nervous hesitation and tremor. I
feared to tread, lest I should be precipitated into some abyss. I
remembered, too, strange stories told about these Ragged Hills, and of
the uncouth and fierce races of men who tenanted their groves and
caverns. A thousand vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me-
fancies the more distressing because vague. Very suddenly my attention
was arrested by the loud beating of a drum.

  "My amazement was, of course, extreme. A drum in these hills was a
thing unknown. I could not have been more surprised at the sound of
the trump of the Archangel. But a new and still more astounding source
of interest and perplexity arose. There came a wild rattling or
jingling sound, as if of a bunch of large keys, and upon the instant a
dusky-visaged and half-naked man rushed past me with a shriek. He came
so close to my person that I felt his hot breath upon my face. He bore
in one hand an instrument composed of an assemblage of steel rings,
and shook them vigorously as he ran. Scarcely had he disappeared in
the mist before, panting after him, with open mouth and glaring
eyes, there darted a huge beast. I could not be mistaken in its
character. It was a hyena.

  "The sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my
terrors- for I now made sure that I dreamed, and endeavored to
arouse myself to waking consciousness. I stepped boldly and briskly
forward. I rubbed my eyes. I called aloud. I pinched my limbs. A small
spring of water presented itself to my view, and here, stooping, I
bathed my hands and my head and neck. This seemed to dissipate the
equivocal sensations which had hitherto annoyed me. I arose, as I
thought, a new man, and proceeded steadily and complacently on my
unknown way.

  "At length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a certain
oppressive closeness of the atmosphere, I seated myself beneath a
tree. Presently there came a feeble gleam of sunshine, and the
shadow of the leaves of the tree fell faintly but definitely upon
the grass. At this shadow I gazed wonderingly for many minutes. Its
character stupefied me with astonishment. I looked upward. The tree
was a palm.

  "I now arose hurriedly, and in a state of fearful agitation- for the
fancy that I dreamed would serve me no longer. I saw- I felt that I
had perfect command of my senses- and these senses now brought to my
soul a world of novel and singular sensation. The heat became all at
once intolerable. A strange odor loaded the breeze. A low,
continuous murmur, like that arising from a full, but gently flowing
river, came to my ears, intermingled with the peculiar hum of
multitudinous human voices.

  "While I listened in an extremity of astonishment which I need not
attempt to describe, a strong and brief gust of wind bore off the
incumbent fog as if by the wand of an enchanter.

  "I found myself at the foot of a high mountain, and looking down
into a vast plain, through which wound a majestic river. On the margin
of this river stood an Eastern-looking city, such as we read of in the
Arabian Tales, but of a character even more singular than any there
described. From my position, which was far above the level of the
town, I could perceive its every nook and corner, as if delineated
on a map. The streets seemed innumerable, and crossed each other
irregularly in all directions, but were rather long winding alleys
than streets, and absolutely swarmed with inhabitants. The houses were
wildly picturesque. On every hand was a wilderness of balconies, of
verandas, of minarets, of shrines, and fantastically carved oriels.
Bazaars abounded; and in these were displayed rich wares in infinite
variety and profusion- silks, muslins, the most dazzling cutlery,
the most magnificent jewels and gems. Besides these things, were seen,
on all sides, banners and palanquins, litters with stately dames close
veiled, elephants gorgeously caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn,
drums, banners, and gongs, spears, silver and gilded maces. And amid
the crowd, and the clamor, and the general intricacy and confusion-
amid the million of black and yellow men, turbaned and robed, and of
flowing beard, there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted
bulls, while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered,
chattering and shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or
clung to the minarets and oriels. From the swarming streets to the
banks of the river, there descended innumerable flights of steps
leading to bathing places, while the river itself seemed to force a
passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of deeply- burthened
ships that far and wide encountered its surface. Beyond the limits
of the city arose, in frequent majestic groups, the palm and the
cocoa, with other gigantic and weird trees of vast age, and here and
there might be seen a field of rice, the thatched hut of a peasant,
a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp, or a solitary graceful maiden
taking her way, with a pitcher upon her head, to the banks of the
magnificent river.

  "You will say now, of course, that I dreamed; but not so. What I
saw- what I heard- what I felt- what I thought- had about it nothing
of the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream. All was rigorously
self-consistent. At first, doubting that I was really awake, I entered
into a series of tests, which soon convinced me that I really was.
Now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects that he dreams,
the suspicion never fails to confirm itself, and the sleeper is almost
immediately aroused. Thus Novalis errs not in saying that 'we are near
waking when we dream that we dream.' Had the vision occurred to me
as I describe it, without my suspecting it as a dream, then a dream it
might absolutely have been, but, occurring as it did, and suspected
and tested as it was, I am forced to class it among other phenomena."

  "In this I am not sure that you are wrong," observed Dr.
Templeton, "but proceed. You arose and descended into the city."

  "I arose," continued Bedloe, regarding the Doctor with an air of
profound astonishment "I arose, as you say, and descended into the
city. On my way I fell in with an immense populace, crowding through
every avenue, all in the same direction, and exhibiting in every
action the wildest excitement. Very suddenly, and by some
inconceivable impulse, I became intensely imbued with personal
interest in what was going on. I seemed to feel that I had an
important part to play, without exactly understanding what it was.
Against the crowd which environed me, however, I experienced a deep
sentiment of animosity. I shrank from amid them, and, swiftly, by a
circuitous path, reached and entered the city. Here all was the
wildest tumult and contention. A small party of men, clad in
garments half-Indian, half-European, and officered by gentlemen in a
uniform partly British, were engaged, at great odds, with the swarming
rabble of the alleys. I joined the weaker party, arming myself with
the weapons of a fallen officer, and fighting I knew not whom with the
nervous ferocity of despair. We were soon overpowered by numbers,
and driven to seek refuge in a species of kiosk. Here we barricaded
ourselves, and, for the present were secure. From a loop-hole near the
summit of the kiosk, I perceived a vast crowd, in furious agitation,
surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung the river.
Presently, from an upper window of this place, there descended an
effeminate-looking person, by means of a string made of the turbans of
his attendants. A boat was at hand, in which he escaped to the
opposite bank of the river.

  "And now a new object took possession of my soul. I spoke a few
hurried but energetic words to my companions, and, having succeeded in
gaining over a few of them to my purpose made a frantic sally from the
kiosk. We rushed amid the crowd that surrounded it. They retreated, at
first, before us. They rallied, fought madly, and retreated again.
In the mean time we were borne far from the kiosk, and became
bewildered and entangled among the narrow streets of tall, overhanging
houses, into the recesses of which the sun had never been able to
shine. The rabble pressed impetuously upon us, harrassing us with
their spears, and overwhelming us with flights of arrows. These latter
were very remarkable, and resembled in some respects the writhing
creese of the Malay. They were made to imitate the body of a
creeping serpent, and were long and black, with a poisoned barb. One
of them struck me upon the right temple. I reeled and fell. An
instantaneous and dreadful sickness seized me. I struggled- I
gasped- I died."

 "You will hardly persist now," said I smiling, "that the whole of
your adventure was not a dream. You are not prepared to maintain
that you are dead?"

  When I said these words, I of course expected some lively sally from
Bedloe in reply, but, to my astonishment, he hesitated, trembled,
became fearfully pallid, and remained silent. I looked toward
Templeton. He sat erect and rigid in his chair- his teeth chattered,
and his eyes were starting from their sockets. "Proceed!" he at length
said hoarsely to Bedloe.

  "For many minutes," continued the latter, "my sole sentiment- my
sole feeling- was that of darkness and nonentity, with the
consciousness of death. At length there seemed to pass a violent and
sudden shock through my soul, as if of electricity. With it came the
sense of elasticity and of light. This latter I felt- not saw. In an
instant I seemed to rise from the ground. But I had no bodily, no
visible, audible, or palpable presence. The crowd had departed. The
tumult had ceased. The city was in comparative repose. Beneath me
lay my corpse, with the arrow in my temple, the whole head greatly
swollen and disfigured. But all these things I felt- not saw. I took
interest in nothing. Even the corpse seemed a matter in which I had no
concern. Volition I had none, but appeared to be impelled into motion,
and flitted buoyantly out of the city, retracing the circuitous path
by which I had entered it. When I had attained that point of the
ravine in the mountains at which I had encountered the hyena, I
again experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery, the sense of
weight, of volition, of substance, returned. I became my original
self, and bent my steps eagerly homeward- but the past had not lost
the vividness of the real- and not now, even for an instant, can I
compel my understanding to regard it as a dream."

  "Nor was it," said Templeton, with an air of deep solemnity, "yet it
would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed. Let us
suppose only, that the soul of the man of to-day is upon the verge
of some stupendous psychal discoveries. Let us content ourselves
with this supposition. For the rest I have some explanation to make.
Here is a watercolor drawing, which I should have shown you before,
but which an unaccountable sentiment of horror has hitherto
prevented me from showing."

  We looked at the picture which he presented. I saw nothing in it
of an extraordinary character, but its effect upon Bedloe was
prodigious. He nearly fainted as he gazed. And yet it was but a
miniature portrait- a miraculously accurate one, to be sure- of his
own very remarkable features. At least this was my thought as I
regarded it.

  "You will perceive," said Templeton, "the date of this picture- it
is here, scarcely visible, in this corner- 1780. In this year was
the portrait taken. It is the likeness of a dead friend- a Mr.
Oldeb- to whom I became much attached at Calcutta, during the
administration of Warren Hastings. I was then only twenty years old.
When I first saw you, Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was the miraculous
similarity which existed between yourself and the painting which
induced me to accost you, to seek your friendship, and to bring
about those arrangements which resulted in my becoming your constant
companion. In accomplishing this point, I was urged partly, and
perhaps principally, by a regretful memory of the deceased, but
also, in part, by an uneasy, and not altogether horrorless curiosity
respecting yourself.

  "In your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid the
hills, you have described, with the minutest accuracy, the Indian city
of Benares, upon the Holy River. The riots, the combat, the
massacre, were the actual events of the insurrection of Cheyte Sing,
which took place in 1780, when Hastings was put in imminent peril of
his life. The man escaping by the string of turbans was Cheyte Sing
himself. The party in the kiosk were sepoys and British officers,
headed by Hastings. Of this party I was one, and did all I could to
prevent the rash and fatal sally of the officer who fell, in the
crowded alleys, by the poisoned arrow of a Bengalee. That officer
was my dearest friend. It was Oldeb. You will perceive by these
manuscripts," (here the speaker produced a note-book in which
several pages appeared to have been freshly written,) "that at the
very period in which you fancied these things amid the hills, I was
engaged in detailing them upon paper here at home."

  In about a week after this conversation, the following paragraphs
appeared in a Charlottesville paper:

  "We have the painful duty of announcing the death of Mr. Augustus
Bedlo, a gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have long
endeared him to the citizens of Charlottesville.

  "Mr. B., for some years past, has been subject to neuralgia, which
has often threatened to terminate fatally; but this can be regarded
only as the mediate cause of his decease. The proximate cause was
one of especial singularity. In an excursion to the Ragged
Mountains, a few days since, a slight cold and fever were
contracted, attended with great determination of blood to the head. To
relieve this, Dr. Templeton resorted to topical bleeding. Leeches were
applied to the temples. In a fearfully brief period the patient
died, when it appeared that in the jar containing the leeches, had
been introduced, by accident, one of the venomous vermicular
sangsues which are now and then found in the neighboring ponds. This
creature fastened itself upon a small artery in the right temple.
Its close resemblance to the medicinal leech caused the mistake to
be overlooked until too late.

  "N. B. The poisonous sangsue of Charlottesville may always be
distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness, and
especially by its writhing or vermicular motions, which very nearly
resemble those of a snake."

  I was speaking with the editor of the paper in question, upon the
topic of this remarkable accident, when it occurred to me to ask how
it happened that the name of the deceased had been given as Bedlo.

  "I presume," I said, "you have authority for this spelling, but I
have always supposed the name to be written with an e at the end."

  "Authority?- no," he replied. "It is a mere typographical error. The
name is Bedlo with an e, all the world over, and I never knew it to be
spelt otherwise in my life."

  "Then," said I mutteringly, as I turned upon my heel, "then indeed
has it come to pass that one truth is stranger than any fiction- for
Bedloe, without the e, what is it but Oldeb conversed! And this man
tells me that it is a typographical error."

                             THE END
.
