                                    THE POET
                                   A FRAGMENT
                                 by John Keats

        Where's the Poet? show him! show him,
        Muses nine! that I may know him!
        'Tis the man who with a man
          Is an equal, be he King
        Or poorest of the beggar-clan,
          Or any other wondrous thing
        A man may be 'twixt ape and Plato;
          'Tis the man who with a bird,
        Wren or eagle, finds his way to
          All its instincts; he hath heard
        The lion's roaring, and can tell
          What his horny throat expresseth,
        And to him the tiger's yell
          Comes articulate and presseth
        On his ear like mother-tongue...

                        THE END
