                               by Edgar Allan Poe
SONG

    I saw thee on thy bridal day-
      When a burning blush came o'er thee,
    Though happiness around thee lay,
      The world all love before thee:

    And in thine eye a kindling light
      (Whatever it might be)
    Was all on Earth my aching sight
      Of Loveliness could see.

    That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame-
      As such it well may pass-
    Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
      In the breast of him, alas!

    Who saw thee on that bridal day,
      When that deep blush would come o'er thee,
    Though happiness around thee lay;
      The world all love before thee.

                  -THE END-
.
