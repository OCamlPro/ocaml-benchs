Introduction to the third edition 
 
 
 
The Probert E-Text Encyclopaedia is intended to satisfy the need for a  
freely distributable, machine readable, general knowledge reference  
work. In addition, it seeks to address more obscure issues which  
existing general knowledge multimedia encyclopaedias may omit, in this  
way providing a useful supplement to existing commercial applications.  
 
 
 
Following the success and popularity of the previous editions of the  
Probert E-Text Encyclopaedia I have now considerably enlarged and  
corrected the text. There is still a lot of data which should be  
added, and enlarged editions will follow. Please contact the author  
for details of the latest edition, details of other formats including  
CSV and HTML.

milk. The skin is covered in two types of glands: sweat glands and 
sebaceous glands. The sweat glands secrete a watery fluid to assist body 
cooling. The sebaceous glands secrete an oily fluid to maintain water 
resistance in the hair. The heart has two auricles and two ventricles.

MTBF is an estimate of averages, half of the devices can be expected to 
fail before then, and half after. MTBF cannot be used as a guarantee.
