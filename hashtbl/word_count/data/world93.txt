Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

We need your donations more than ever!

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Illinois Benedictine College (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMTED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

This is a preliminary edition.  The final first edition should be on
file around midnight, October 31, 1993.

As usual, the margination in these reports may be rough, and another
edition should appear, somewhat neater in appearance, as a Gutenberg
volunteer will probably start work on this shortly.

This file has been edited in such a manner as to delete redundancies
[some, not all] and extra spaces [some, not all], enough that a file
from Project Gutenberg should be enough smaller that storarge/search
requirements should be reduced by 15 to 20%.

There have been some significant changes in this edition. Czechoslovakia has
been superseded by the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Eritrea gained independence
from Ethiopia. The name of the Ivory Coast has been changed to Cote d'Ivoire and
the Vatican City became the Holy See. New entries include Location, Map
references, Abbreviation (often substituted for the country name), and Digraph
(two-letter country code). Names is a new entry which includes long and short
forms of both conventional and local names of countries as well as any former
names. Most diacritical marks have been omitted. The electronic files used to
produce the Factbook have been restructured into a database. As a result, the
formats of some entries in this edition have been changed. Additional changes
will occur in the 1994 Factbook. Irrigated land is a new entry with the data
separate from the Land use entry. The Disputes entry is now International
disputes. The GNP/GDP entry was renamed National Product and the per capita and
real growth rate data placed in separate entries. Similar changes were made in
the Population and Diplomatic Representation entries.

Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and first-order
administrative divisions are generally those approved by the US Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on by
BGN are noted.

Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all
surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding
inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Comparative areas are based on
total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of
the 50 states. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 km2,
69 miles 2) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 km2, 0.23 miles 2,146 acres).

Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000
population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate.

Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1993 was
used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates for 1
July 1993, with population growth rates estimated for calendar year 1993. Major
political events have been updated through June 1993.

Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000
population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.

Digraphs: The digraph is a two-letter "country code'' that precisely identifies
every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the
digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized geopolitical data element
promulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS)
10-3 by the National Bureau of Standards (US Department of Commerce) and
maintained by the Office of the Geographer (US Department of State). The digraph
is used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection,
processing, and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful
for interchanging data between databases.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with 180
nations. The US has diplomatic relations with 174 of the 182 UN members
(excluding the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia whose status in the UN
is unclear)--the exceptions are Angola, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Macedonia,
North Korea, and Vietnam. In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 7
nations that are not in the UN-Andorra, Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru, Switzerland,
Tonga, and Tuvalu.

Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development
assistance (ODA), which is defined as government grants that are administered
with the promotion of economic development and welfare of LDCs as their main
objective and are concessional in character and contain a grant element of at
least 25%, and other official flows (OOF) or transactions by the official sector
whose main objective is other than development motivated or whose grant element
is below the 25% threshold for ODA. OOF transactions include official export
credits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits), official equity and portfolio investment,
and debt reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional
terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are initialed by
the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration of intent.

Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,
and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others are
not officially recognized by the US Government. "Nation'' refers to a people
politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
"Dependent area" refers to a broad category of political entities that are
associated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually
the short-form names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are
266 entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

Exchange rate: The value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over a
given period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and
as determined by international market forces or official fiat.

Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and services produced
domestically in a given year.

Gross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and services produced
domestically in a given year, plus income earned abroad, minus income earned by
foreigners from domestic production.

Gross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and services
produced worldwide in a given year.

GNP/GDP methodology: In the "Economy'' section, GNP/GDP dollar estimates for the
OECD countries, the former Soviet republics, and the East European countries are
derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than from
conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method normally
involves the use of international dollar price weights, which are applied to the
quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In addition to the
lack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the statistician faces a
major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing for the quality of
goods and services. The division of a PPP GNP/GDP estimate in dollars by the
corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP conversion rate. One
thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one
thousand dollars--converted to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate--
will buy in the other country. GNP/GDP estimates for the LDCs, on the other
hand, are based on the conversion of GNP/GDP estimates in local currencies to
dollars at the official currency exchange rates. Because currency exchange rates
depend on a variety of international and domestic financial forces that often
have little relation to domestic output, use of these rates is less satisfactory
for calculating GNP/GDP than the PPP method. Furthermore, exchange rates may
suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat
whereas real output has remained unchanged. One additional caution: the
proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP in local
currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP
accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer estimates
the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures; similar problems
exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency exchange rate
procedures. Finally, as academic research moves forward on the PPP method, we
hope to convert all GNP/GDP estimates to this method in future editions of The
World Factbook.

Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population, resulting
from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants
entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.

Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs--narcotics,
stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These
categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well
as those illegally produced and sold outside medical channels.

Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,
Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish
(hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).

Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the stimulant
cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and
is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.

Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.

Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include
chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),
benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide
(Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).

Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional, or
behavioral change in an individual.

Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in
physical,
mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual.

Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and
emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc,
buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP,

(psilocybin, psilocyn).

Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).

Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.

Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).

Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium,
opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium
(paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol
w/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic
narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic
narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone

and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine),
phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert,
Sanorex, Tenuate).

Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in a
given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.

International disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations that
range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one
sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international boundaries
and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the Department of State. References
to other situations may also be included that are border or frontier relevant,
such as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.
However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or
recognition by the US Government.

Irrigated land: The figure refers to the number of km 2 that is artifically
supplied with water.

Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable land--land
cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize, rice);
permanent crops--land cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each
harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures--land permanently used
for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland land--under dense or open
stands of trees; and other--any land type not specifically mentioned above
(urban areas, roads, desert).

Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who represents
the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not involved with the day-
to-day activities of the government. The head of government is the
administrative leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the government.
In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime Minister is the head
of government. In the US, the President is both the chief of state and the head
of government.

Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group of
people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in
the future.

Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless
otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition--the ability
to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual
countries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of
this publication.

Maps: All maps will be available only in the printed version of The World
Factbook for the foreseeable future.

Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national
claims from being extended the full distance.

Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial
vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing
vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; also, a grouping of merchant ships by
nationality or register.

Captive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory, possession, or
colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent
country; also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an
internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the
parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime
laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a
captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent
country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad.
The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it
is not the register of an independent state.

Flag of convenience register--A national register offering registration to a
merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC)
attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent
taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are
characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in
the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the
merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.

Flag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal
jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad. Differences
in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and
whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.

Internal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national
register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that
nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on
the main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation of
profits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag
state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International Ship
Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of
an internal register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the
national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to
the Norwegian and Danish flags.

Merchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight; commonly
used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial
vessels only.

Register--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with the
maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual
ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and
makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag state)
regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.

Money figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise
indicated.

National product: The total output of goods and services in a country in a given
year. See Gross domestic product (GDP), Gross national product (GNP), and
GNP/GDP methodology.

Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering and
leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear
population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net
immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).

Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on
statistics from population censuses, vital registration systems, or sample
surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future trends.

Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per
woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore
children according to a given fertility rate at each age.

Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as
fiscal year (FY).

*Afghanistan, Economy

Overview:
  Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly
  dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and
  goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political and
  military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including the nearly
  10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). Over the
  past decade, one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan
  sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3 million. Another
  1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.
  Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product is lower than
  12 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of
  trade and transport.

*Albania, Economy

Overview:
  The Albanian economy, already providing the lowest standard of living in
  Europe, contracted sharply in 1991, with most industries producing at only a
  fraction of past levels and an unemployment rate estimated at 40%. For over
  40 years, the Stalinist-type economy operated on the principle of central
  planning and state ownership of the means of production. Fitful economic
  reforms begun during 1991, including the liberalization of prices and trade,
  the privatization of shops and transport, and land reform, were crippled by
  widespread civil disorder. Following its overwhelming victory in the 22
  March 1992 elections, the new Democratic government announced a program of
  shock therapy to stabilize the economy and establish a market economy. In an
  effort to expand international ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic
  relations with the major republics of the former Soviet Union and the US and
  has joined the IMF and the World Bank. The Albanians have also passed
  legislation allowing foreign investment, but not foreign ownership of real
  estate. Albania possesses considerable mineral resources and, until 1990,
  was largely self-sufficient in food; however, the breakup of cooperative
  farms in 1991 and general economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign
  aid to maintain adequate supplies. In 1992 the government tightened
  budgetary contols leading to another drop in domestic output. The
  agricultural sector is steadily gaining from the privatization process. Low
  domestic output is supplemented by remittances from the 200,000 Albanians
  working abroad.

*Algeria, Economy

Overview:
  The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy,
  hydrocarbons accounting for nearly all export receipts, about 30% of
  government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in
  oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
  program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the
  mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the
  nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since full
  independence in 1988. The current government has put reform, including
  privatization of some public sector companies and an overhaul of the banking
  and financial system, on hold, but has continued efforts to admit private
  enterprise to the hydrocarbon industry.

*Andorra, Economy

Overview:
  The mainstay of Andorra's economy is tourism. An estimated 13 million
  tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its
  summer and winter resorts. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status,
  also contributes significantly to the economy. Agricultural production is
  limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The
  principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly
  of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Although it is a member of the EC
  customs union, it is unclear what effect the European Single Market will
  have on the advantages Andorra obtains from its duty-free status.

*Angola, Economy

Overview:
  Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80-90% of the
  population, but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil production is vital
  to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. Bitter internal fighting
  continues to severely affect the nonoil economy, and food needs to be
  imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural
  resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To
  realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace
  but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
  imbalances throughout the economy.

International disputes:
  Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic Treaty Summary below);
  sections (some overlapping) claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France
  (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and
  UK; the US and most other nations do not recognize the territorial claims of
  other nations and have made no claims themselves (the US and Russia reserve
  the right to do so); no formal claims have been made in the sector between
  90 degrees west and 150 degrees west, where, because of floating ice,
  Antarctica is unapproachable from the sea
Climate:
  severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the
  ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher
  elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher
  temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below
  freezing
Terrain:
  about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average
  elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to 4,897
  meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land,
  Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of Ross Island on
  McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline,
  and floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent

  storms that form over the ocean; during summer more solar radiation reaches
  the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
  equivalent period; in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield,
  which protects the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had
  dwindled to the lowest level ever recorded over Antarctica; active volcanism

 Antarctic Treaty Summary:
  The Antarctic Treaty, signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23
  June 1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of Antarctica.
  Administration is carried out through consultative member meetings--the 17th
  Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Venice in November 1992.
  Currently, there are 41 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and 15
  acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim
  portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and 19
  nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made no claims
  have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize the claims of
  others. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation was voted
  to full consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates the country
  was an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are--Argentina,
  Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant
  consultative nations are--Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador
  (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan,
  South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South
  Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia.
  Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parentheses,
  are--Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988), Cuba
  (1984), Czechoslovakia (1962), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987), Guatemala
  (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania
  (1971), Switzerland (1990), and Ukraine (1992).
 Article 1:
  area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as
  weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and equipment may be
  used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose
 Article 2:
  freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation shall continue
 Article 3:
  free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with the UN and
  other international agencies
 Article 4:
  does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial claims and no new
  claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force
 Article 5:
  prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes
 Article 6:
  includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00
  minutes south
 Article 7:
  treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial observation, to
  any area and may inspect all stations, installations, and equipment; advance
  notice of all activities and of the introduction of military personnel must
  be given
 Article 8:
  allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states
 Article 9:
  frequent consultative meetings take place among member nations

*Antarctica, Government

 Article 10:
  treaty states will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica that
  are contrary to the treaty
 Article 11:
  disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, ultimately,
  by the ICJ
 Article 12, 13, 14:
  deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved
  nations
 Other agreements:
  more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative meetings and
  ratified by governments include - Agreed Measures for the Conservation of
  Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964); Convention for the Conservation of
  Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
  Living Resources (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988
  but was subsequently rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental
  Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits ratification; this
  agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through
  five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental
  impact assessments, waste management, and protected areas; it also prohibits
  all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific research;
  four parties have ratified Protocol as of June 1993
Legal system:
  US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such
  as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other countries.
  Some US laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic
  Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. section 2401 et seq., provides civil and
  criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized by
  regulation of statute: The taking of native mammals or birds; the
  introduction of nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially
  protected or scientific areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and
  the importation into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of
  the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines
  and 1 year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Transportation,
  and Interior share enforcement responsibilities. Public Law 95-541, the US
  Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the US to
  Antarctica to notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs,
  Room 5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such
  plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more
  information contact Permit Office, Office of Polar Programs, National
  Science Foundation, Washington, DC 20550.

*Antigua and Barbuda, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism the most important
  determinant of economic performance. During the period 1987-90, real GDP
  expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%. Tourism makes a direct
  contribution to GDP of about 13% and also affects growth in other sectors -
  particularly in construction, communications, and public utilities. Although
  Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a
  labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it has been hurt in 1991-92
  by a downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US
  recession.

Map references:
  Arctic Region, Asia, North America, Standard Time Zones of the World
Area:
 total area:
  14.056 million km2
 comparative area:
  slightly more than 1.5 times the size of the US; smallest of the world's
  four oceans (after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean)
 note:
  includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian
  Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, and
  other tributary water bodies
Coastline:
  45,389 km
International disputes:
  some maritime disputes (see littoral states); Svalbard is the focus of a
  maritime boundary dispute between Norway and Russia
Climate:
  polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual
  temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous darkness, cold and
  stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers characterized by
  continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or
  snow
Terrain:
  central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack that averages
  about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges may be three times
  that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral Stream, but nearly
  straight line movement from the New Siberian Islands (Russia) to Denmark
  Strait (between Greenland and Iceland); the ice pack is surrounded by open
  seas during the summer, but more than doubles in size during the winter and
  extends to the encircling land masses; the ocean floor is about 50%
  continental shelf (highest percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a
  central basin interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera,
  Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonsov Ridge); maximum depth is 4,665 meters in the
  Fram Basin
Natural resources:
  sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, oil and
  gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales)
Environment:
  endangered marine species include walruses and whales; ice islands
  occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island; icebergs calved from
  glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada; maximum snow
  cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean and
  lasts about 10 months; permafrost in islands; virtually icelocked from
  October to June; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from
  disruptions or damage
Note:
  major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the Pacific
  Ocean via the Bering Strait); ships subject to superstructure icing from
  October to May; strategic location between North America and Russia;
  shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia,
  floating research stations operated by the US and Russia

*Argentina, Economy

Overview:
  Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate population,
  an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.
  Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist policies, the
  economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge external debts and recurring
  bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession,
  President MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring
  program that shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable,
  sustainable growth. Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US
  dollar since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20
  years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by
  repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry. Much remains
  to be done in the 1990s in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth
  and in solidifying the recent economic gains.

*Armenia, Economy

Overview:
  Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built up textile,
  machine-building, and other industries and had become a key supplier to
  sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials
  and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the
  republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy has
  been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the
  Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave
  within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright
  warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the
  Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleaguered
  Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed
  about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has
  not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been
  disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central
  USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the
  earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40% of
  Armenia's needs for electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of
  the output of elevators in the former USSR. Armenia has some deposits of
  nonferrous metal ores (bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum) that are
  largely unexploited. For the mid-term, Armenia's economic prospects seem
  particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high
  dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of
  transformation. The dramatic drop in output in 1992 is attributable largely
  to the cumulative impact of the blockade; of particular importance was the
  shutting off in the summer of 1992 of rail and road links to Russia through
  Georgia due to civil strife in the latter republic.

  capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European countries.
  Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural
  products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Of the top 25 exports, 21 are
  primary products, so that, as happened during 1983-84, a downturn in world
  commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy. The government is

*Austria, Economy

Overview:
  Austria boasts a prosperous and stable socialist market economy with a
  sizable proportion of nationalized industry and extensive welfare benefits.
  Thanks to an excellent raw material endowment, a technically skilled labor
  force, and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies
  specialized niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and
  produces almost enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force
  in agriculture. Increased export sales resulting from German unification,
  continued to boost Austria's economy through 1991. However, Germany's
  economic difficulties in 1992 slowed Austria's GDP growth to 2% from the 3%
  of 1991. Austria's economy, moreover, is not expected to grow by more than
  1% in 1993, and inflation is forecast to remain about 4%. Unemployment will
  likely remain at current levels at least until 1994. Living standards in
  Austria are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western
  Europe. Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level
  of subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary
  capabilities. The continued opening of Eastern European markets, however,
  will increase demand for Austrian exports. Austria, a member of the European
  Free Trade Association (EFTA), in 1992 ratified the European Economic Area
  Treaty, which will extend European Community rules on the free movement of
  people, goods, capital and services to the EFTA countries, and Austrians
  plan to hold a national referendum within the next two years to vote on EC
  membership.

*Azerbaijan, Economy

Overview:
  Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia,
  the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in
  its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low
  standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, oil,
  and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline
  for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate
  the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,
  marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim
  Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan
  accounted for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former
  Soviet Union. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet
  republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy, but
  its considerable energy resources brighten its propects somewhat. Old
  economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced. A particularly galling
  constraint on economic revival is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said to
  consume 25% of Azerbaijan's economic resources.

*Bangladesh, Economy

Overview:
  Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest, most densely populated, and least
  developed nations. Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural. Major
  impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, government
  interference with the economy, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be
  absorbed by agriculture, a low level of industrialization, failure to fully
  exploit energy resources (natural gas), and inefficient and inadequate power
  supplies. An excellent rice crop and expansion of the export garment
  industry helped growth in FY91/92. Policy reforms intended to reduce
  government regulation of private industry and promote public-sector
  efficiency have been announced but are being implemented only slowly.

*Barbados, Economy

Overview:
  A per capita income of $7,000 gives Barbados one of the highest standards of
  living of all the small island states of the eastern Caribbean.
  Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation of sugarcane and
  related activities. In recent years, however, the economy has diversified
  into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist industry is now a major employer
  of the labor force and a primary source of foreign exchange. The economy
  slowed in 1990-91, however, and Bridgetown's declining hard currency
  reserves and inability to finance its deficits have caused it to adopt an
  austere economic reform program.

*Belarus, Economy

Overview:
  In many ways Belarus resembles the three Baltic states, for example, in its
  industrial competence, its higher-than-average standard of living, and its
  critical dependence on the other former Soviet states for fuels and raw
  materials. Belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former Soviet
  republics, having produced 4% of the total GDP and employing 4% of the labor
  force in the old USSR. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now supplies
  important producer and consumer goods - sometimes as the sole producer - to
  the other states. Belarus had a significant share of the machine-building
  capacity of the former USSR. It is especially noted for production of
  tractors, large trucks, machine tools, and automation equipment. The soil in
  Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by emphasizing
  favorable crops and livestock (especially pigs and chickens), Belarus has
  become a net exporter to the other former republics of meat, milk, eggs,
  flour, and potatoes. Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and gas and
  receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil pipeline and
  the Northern Lights gas pipeline. These pipelines transit Belarus en route
  to Eastern Europe. Belarus produces petrochemicals, plastics, synthetic
  fibers (nearly 30% of former Soviet output), and fertilizer (20% of former
  Soviet output). Raw material resources are limited to potash and peat
  deposits. The peat (more than one-third of the total for the former Soviet
  Union) is used in domestic heating, as boiler fuel for electric power
  stations, and in the production of chemicals. The potash supports fertilizer
  production. In 1992 GDP fell an estimated 13%, largely because the country
  is highly dependent on the ailing Russian economy for raw materials and
  parts.

*Belgium, Economy

Overview:
  This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its central
  geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified
  industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in the
  populous Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging
  reinvestment in the southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources
  Belgium must import essential raw materials, making its economy closely
  dependent on the state of world markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC
  countries. The economy grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90,
  but economic growth slowed to a 1% pace in 1991-92. The economy is expected
  to turn in another sluggish 1% performance in 1993. Belgium's public debt
  remains high at 120% of GDP and the government is trying to control its
  expenditures to bring the figure more into line with other industrialized
  countries.

*Bhutan, Economy

Overview:
  The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on agriculture and
  forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of the population and
  account for about 50% of GDP. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make
  the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The
  economy is closely aligned with that of India through strong trade and
  monetary links. The industrial sector is small and technologically backward,
  with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development
  projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's
  hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are its most important
  natural resources; however, the government limits the number of tourists to
  3,000/year to minimize foreign influence.

*Bolivia, Economy

Overview:
  With its long history of semifeudalistic social controls, dependence on
  volatile prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of hyperinflation,
  Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least developed Latin American
  countries. Since August 1989, President PAZ Zamora, despite his Marxist
  origins, has maintained a moderate policy of repressing domestic terrorism,
  containing inflation, and achieving annual GDP growth of 3 to 4%. For many
  farmers, who constitute half of the country's work force, the main cash crop
  is coca, which is sold for cocaine processing.

*Bosnia and Herzegovina, Header

Note:
  Bosnia and Herzegovina is suffering from interethnic civil strife which
  began in March 1992 after the Bosnian Government held a referendum on
  independence. Bosnia's Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia - responded
  with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines
  and joining Serb held areas to a "greater Serbia". Since the onset of the
  conflict, which has driven approximately half of the pre-war population of
  4.4 million from their homes, both the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Croats
  have asserted control of more than three-quarters of the territory formerly
  under the control of the Bosnian Government. The UN and the EC are
  continuing to try to mediate a plan for peace.

*Bosnia and Herzegovina, Economy

Overview:
  Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest republic in
  the old Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in
  private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic
  traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly
  overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning
  and management. Tito had pushed the development of military industries in
  the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of
  Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of March 1993, Bosnia and Herzegovina was
  being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic warfare that has caused
  production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar, and human misery
  to multiply. No reliable economic statistics for 1992 are available,
  although output clearly fell below the already depressed 1991 level.

*Botswana, Economy

Overview:
  The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops.
  Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the population,
  but produces only about 50% of food needs. The driving force behind the
  rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry.
  This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating
  25% of GDP in 1980 to 50% in 1991. No other sector has experienced such
  growth, especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
  poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Although diamond
  production was down slightly in 1992, substantial gains in coal output and
  manufacturing helped boost the economy

*Brazil, Economy

Overview:
  The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors, entered
  the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an unserviceable
  foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy direction. In addition,
  the economy remained highly regulated, inward-looking, and protected by
  substantial trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and
  mining facilities is divided among private interests - including several
  multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are
  private, with the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts
  between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
  violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed office in March 1990,
  launched an ambitious reform program that sought to modernize and
  reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy,
  and opening it to increased foreign competition. The government also
  obtained an IMF standby loan in January 1992 and reached agreements with
  commercial bankers on the repayment of interest arrears and on the reduction
  of debt and debt service payments. Galloping inflation - the rate doubled in
  1992 - continues to undermine economic stability. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed
  the presidency following President COLLOR'S resignation in December 1992,
  has promised to support the basic premises of COLLOR'S reform program but
  has yet to define clearly his economic policies. Brazil's natural resources
  remain a major, long-term economic strength.

*British Virgin Islands, Economy

Overview:
  The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, is highly
  dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21% of the national
  income. In 1985 the government offered offshore registration to companies
  wishing to incorporate in the islands, and, in consequence, incorporation
  fees generated about $2 million in 1987. The economy slowed in 1991 because
  of the poor performances of the tourist sector and tight commercial bank
  credit. Livestock raising is the most significant agricultural activity. The
  islands' crops, limited by poor soils, are unable to meet food requirements.

*Bulgaria, Economy

Overview:
  Growth in the lackluster Bulgarian economy fell to the 2% annual level in
  the 1980s. By 1990, Sofia's foreign debt had skyrocketed to over $10 billion
  - giving a debt-service ratio of more than 40% of hard currency earnings and
  leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments.
  The post-Communist government faces major problems of renovating an aging
  industrial plant; keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological
  developments; investing in additional energy capacity (the portion of
  electric power from nuclear energy reached over one-third in 1990); and
  motivating workers, in part by giving them a share in the earnings of their
  enterprises. Political bickering in Sofia and the collapse of the DIMITROV
  government in October 1992 have slowed the economic reform process. New
  Prime Minister BEROV, however, has pledged to continue the reforms initiated
  by the previous government. He has promised to continue cooperation with the
  World Bank and IMF, advance negotiations on rescheduling commercial debt,
  and push ahead with privatization. BEROV's government - whose main
  parliamentary supporters are the former Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party
  (BSP) - nonetheless appears likely to pursue more interventionist tactics in
  overcoming the country's economic problems.

*Burma, Economy

Overview:
  Burma is a poor Asian country, with a per capita GDP of about $660. The
  nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export
  earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity exports.
  For rice, traditionally the most important export, the drop in world prices
  has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales. In
  1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this
  position. The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which
  generates about 40% of GDP and provides employment for 65% of the work
  force. Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces
  and has been trying to encourage foreign investment, so far with little
  success.

*Burundi, Economy

Overview:
  A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of economic
  development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
  industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which accounts
  for an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each year. The ability to
  pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
  climate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic reform
  agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi
  is trying to diversify its agricultural exports and attract foreign
  investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee companies were privatized
  via public auction in September 1991.

*Cambodia, Economy

Overview:
  Cambodia remains a desperately poor country whose economic recovery is held
  hostage to continued political unrest and factional hostilities. The
  country's immediate economic challenge is an acute financial crisis that is
  undermining monetary stability and preventing disbursement of foreign
  development assistance. Cambodia is still recovering from an abrupt shift in
  1990 to free-market economic mechanisms and a cutoff in aid from former
  Soviet bloc countries; these changes have severely impacted on public sector
  revenues and performance. The country's infrastructure of roads, bridges,
  and power plants has been severely degraded, now having only 40-50% of
  prewar capacity. The economy remains essentially rural, with 90% of the
  population living in the countryside and dependent mainly on subsistence
  agriculture. Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and
  unreliable.

*Cameroon, Economy

Overview:
  Because of its offshore oil resources, Cameroon has one of the highest
  incomes per capita in tropical Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious
  problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political
  instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate
  for business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led rapid
  economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986
  precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee,
  cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and
  inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-92, with support
  from the IMF and World Bank, the government has begun to introduce reforms
  designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture,
  and recapitalize the nation's banks. Nationwide strikes organized by
  opposition parties in 1991, however, undermined these efforts.

*Canada, Economy

Overview:
  As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles
  the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic system, and pattern of
  production. Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
  mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
  economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada
  registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations,
  averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force,
  and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. However,
  the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and French-speaking
  areas has observers discussing a possible split in the confederation; foregn
  investors have become edgy.

*Cape Verde, Economy

Overview:
  Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base, a
  serious, long-term drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service
  oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 60%
  of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas,
  agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the fishing sector accounts for 4%.
  About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster
  and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only 3.5% of
  GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances
  from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the new
  democratic government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the private
  sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.

*Central African Republic, Economy

Overview:
  Subsistence agriculture, including forestry, is the backbone of the CAR
  economy, with more than 70% of the population living in the countryside. In
  1988 the agricultural sector generated about 40% of GDP. Agricultural
  products accounted for about 60% of export earnings and the diamond industry
  for 30%. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's
  landlocked position, a poor transportation system, and a weak human resource
  base. Multilateral and bilateral development assistance, particularly from
  France, plays a major role in providing capital for new investment.

*Chad, Economy

Overview:
  The climate, geographic location, and lack of infrastructure and natural
  resources make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in the world.
  Its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war, conflict with Libya,
  drought, and food shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its 1977 level,
  with cotton, the major cash crop, accounting for 48% of exports. Over 80% of
  the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing. Industry is
  based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural products, including
  cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, with
  its economy in trouble and many regions suffering from shortages. Oil
  companies are exploring areas north of Lake Chad and in the Doba basin in
  the south. Good crop weather led to 8.4% growth in 1991.

*Chile, Economy

Overview:
  The government of President AYLWIN, which took power in 1990, retained the
  economic policies of PINOCHET, although the share of spending for social
  welfare has risen steadily. In 1991 growth in GDP recovered to 6% (led by
  consumer spending) after only 2% growth in 1990. The pace accelerated in
  1992 as the result of strong investment and export growth, and GDP rose
  10.4%. Nonetheless, inflation fell further, to 12.7%, compared with 27.3% in
  1990 and 18.7% in 1991. The buoyant economy spurred a 25% growth in imports,
  and the trade surplus fell in 1992, although international reserves
  increased. Inflationary pressures are not expected to ease much in 1993, and
  economic growth is likely to approach 7%.

*China, Economy

Overview:
  Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to move the
  economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy to a more
  productive and flexible economy with market elements, but still within the
  framework of monolithic Communist control. To this end the authorities have
  switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of
  the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and
  plant managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale
  enterprise in services and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign
  economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying
  result has been a strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in
  the early 1980s. Industry also has posted major gains, especially in coastal
  areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and
  modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and
  export goods. Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the
  darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the
  worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of
  capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has
  periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals and
  thereby lessening the credibility of the reform process. In 1991, and again
  in 1992, output rose substantially, particularly in the favored coastal
  areas. Popular resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority
  by rural cadres have weakened China's population control program, which is
  essential to the nation's long-term economic viability.

Overview:
  Phosphate mining had been the only significant economic activity, but in
  December 1987 the Australian Government closed the mine as no longer
  economically viable. Plans have been under way to reopen the mine and also
  to build a casino and hotel to develop tourism, with a possible opening date
  during the first half of 1992.

*Colombia, Economy

Overview:
  Economic development has slowed gradually since 1986, but growth rates
  remain high by Latin American standards. Conservative economic policies have
  kept inflation and unemployment near 30% and 10%, respectively. The rapid
  development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries in recent
  years has helped to offset the decline in coffee prices - Colombia's major
  export. The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in the summer of
  1989, a troublesome rural insurgency, energy rationing, and drug-related
  violence have dampened growth. The level of violence, in Bogota in
  particular, surged to higher levels in the first quarter of 1993, further
  delaying the economic resurgence expected from government reforms. These
  reforms center on fiscal restraint, trade and investment liberalization,
  financial and labor reform, and privatization of state utilities and
  commercial banks.

*Comoros, Economy

Overview:
  One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of several islands
  that have poor transportation links, a young and rapidly increasing
  population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the
  labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity, high
  unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical
  assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the
  leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the
  labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not
  self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the main staple, accounts for
  90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the industrial sector grew at an
  annual average rate of 5.3%, but its contribution to GDP was only 5% in
  1988. Despite major investment in the tourist industry, which accounts for
  about 25% of GDP, growth has stagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of
  1.5% during 1985-90 has led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and
  balance-of-payments difficulties. Preliminary estimates for FY92 show a
  moderate increase in the growth rate based on increased exports, tourism,
  and government investment outlays.

*Congo, Economy

Overview:
  Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, a
  beginning industrial sector based largely on oil, supporting services, and a
  government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. A reform
  program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in
  1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and
  a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay
  of the economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and
  exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to
  finance large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5% annually,
  one of the highest rates in Africa. During the period 1987-91, however,
  growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5% annually, only half the
  population growth rate. The new government, responding to pressure from
  businessmen and the electorate, has promised to reduce the bureaucracy and
  government regulation but little has been accomplished as of early 1993.

*Cook Islands, Economy

Overview:
  Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are fruit,
  copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a
  fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic development
  is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack
  of natural resources and good transportation links. A large trade deficit is
  annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid.
  Current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
  and expanding the fishing industry.

*Costa Rica, Economy

Overview:
  In 1992 the economy grew at an estimated 5.4%, up from the 2.5% gain of 1991
  and the gain of 1990. Increases in agricultural production (on the strength
  of good coffee and banana crops) and in nontraditional exports are
  responsible for much of the growth. In 1992 consumer prices rose by 17%,
  below the 27% of 1991. The trade deficit of $100 million was substantially
  below the 1991 deficit of $270 million. Unemployment is officially reported
  at 4.0%, but much underemployment remains. External debt, on a per capita
  basis, is among the world's highest.

*Cote d'Ivoire, Economy

Overview:
  Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and exporters of
  coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the economy is
  highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and
  cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to
  diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related
  industries. The agricultural sector accounts for over one-third of GDP and
  about 80% of export earnings and employs about 85% of the labor force. A
  collapse of world cocoa and coffee prices in 1986 threw the economy into a
  recession, from which the country had not recovered by 1990. Continuing low
  prices for commodity exports, an overvalued exchange rate, a bloated
  public-sector wage bill, and a large foreign debt hindered economic recovery
  in 1991. The government, which has sponsored various economic reform
  programs, especially in agriculture, projected an increase of 1.6% in GNP in
  1992.
National product:
  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $10 billion (1991)

*Croatia, Economy

Overview:
  Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia, after
  Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized area, with a per capita
  output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps one-third above
  the Yugoslav average. Croatian Serb Nationalists control approximately one
  third of the Croatian territory, and one of the overriding determinants of
  Croatia's long-term political and economic prospects will be the resolution
  of this territorial dispute. Croatia faces monumental problems stemming
  from: the legacy of longtime Communist mismanagement of the economy; large
  foreign debt; damage during the fighting to bridges, factories, powerlines,
  buildings, and houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and
  Bosnian; and the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former
  Yugoslav republics, as well as within its own territory. At the minimum,
  extensive Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil
  industries, would seem necessary to salvage a desperate economic situation.
  However, peace and political stability must come first. As of June 1993,
  fighting continues among Croats, Serbs, and Muslims, and national boundaries
  and final political arrangements are still in doubt.

  Slavonia; central Croatian highlands are less fertile but support cereal
  production, orchards, vineyards, livestock breeding, and dairy farming;

*Cuba, Economy

Overview:
  Since Castro's takeover of Cuba in 1959, the economy has been run in the
  Soviet style of government ownership of substantially all the means of
  production and government planning of all but the smallest details of
  economic activity. Thus, Cuba, like the former Warsaw Pact nations, has
  remained in the backwater of economic modernization. The economy contracted
  by about one-third between 1989 and 1992 as it absorbed the loss of $4
  billion of annual economic aid from the former Soviet Union and much smaller
  amounts from Eastern Europe. The government implemented numerous energy
  conservation measures and import substitution schemes to cope with a large
  decline in imports. To reduce fuel consumption, Havana has cut back bus
  service and imported approximately 1 million bicycles from China,
  domesticated nearly 200,000 oxen to replace tractors, and halted a large
  amount of industrial production. The government has prioritized domestic
  food production and promoted herbal medicines since 1990 to compensate for
  lower imports. Havana also has been shifting its trade away from the former
  Soviet republics and Eastern Europe toward the industrialized countries of
  Latin America and the OECD.

*Cyprus, Economy

Overview:
  The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous. Industry
  contributes 16.5% to GDP and employs 29% of the labor force, while the
  service sector contributes 62% to GDP and employs 57% of the labor force.
  Rapid growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in
  tourism have played important roles in the average 6.8% rise in GDP between
  1986 and 1990. This progress was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the
  adverse effects of the Gulf War on tourism. Nevertheless in mid-1991, the
  World Bank "graduated" Cyprus off its list of developing countries. In
  contrast to the bright picture in the south, the Turkish Cypriot economy has
  less than half the per capita GDP and suffered a series of reverses in 1991.
  Crippled by the effects of the Gulf war, the collapse of the
  fruit-to-electronics conglomerate, Polly Peck, Ltd., and a drought, the
  Turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibillion-dollar grant from Turkey
  to help ease the burden of the economic crisis. In addition, the Turkish
  government extended a $100 million loan in November 1992 to be used for
  economic development projects in 1993. Turkey normally underwrites a
  substantial portion of the Turkish Cypriot economy.

*Czech Republic, Economy

Overview:
  The dissolution of Czechoslovakia into two independent nation states - the
  Czech Republic and Slovakia - on 1 January 1993 has complicated the task of
  moving toward a more open and decentralized economy. The old Czechoslovakia,
  even though highly industrialized by East European standards, suffered from
  an aging capital plant, lagging technology, and a deficiency in energy and
  many raw materials. In January 1991, approximately one year after the end of
  communist control of Eastern Europe, theCzech and Slovak Federal Republic
  launched a sweeping program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and
  controlled economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in
  privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and the
  setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost in
  inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a whole
  inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992, in the Czech
  lands, inflation dropped to an estimated 12.5% and GDP was down a more
  moderate 5%. For 1993 the government of the Czech Republic anticipates
  inflation of 15-20% and a rise in unemployment to perhaps 12% as some
  large-scale enterprises go into bankruptcy; GDP may drop as much as 3%,
  mainly because of the disruption of trade links with Slovakia. Although the
  governments of the Czech Republic and Slovakia had envisaged retaining the
  koruna as a common currency, at least in the short term, the two countries
  ended the currency union in February 1993.

*Denmark, Economy

Overview:
  This modern economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale
  and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable
  living standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark's new
  center-left coalition government will concentrate on reducing the persistent
  high unemployment rate and the budget deficit as well as following the
  previous government's policies of maintaining low inflation and a current
  account surplus. In the face of recent international market pressure on the
  Danish krone, the coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency.
  The coalition hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall
  tax revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax
  reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve welfare
  services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Prime Minister
  RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to EC's economic and
  monetary union (EMU) criteria by 1999, although Copenhagen won from the EC
  the right to opt out of the EMU if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark
  is, in fact, one of the few EC countries likely to fit into the EMU on time.
  Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than many West
  European countries. As the EC's single market (formally established on 1
  January 1993) gets underway, Danish economic growth is expected to pickup to
  around 2% in 1993. Expected Danish approval of the Maastricht treaty on EC
  political and economic union in May 1993 would almost certainly reverse the
  drop in investment, further boosting growth. The current account surplus
  remains strong as limitations on wage increases and low inflation - expected
  to be around 1% in 1993 - improve export competitiveness. Although
  unemployment is high, it remains stable compared to most European countries.

*Djibouti, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is based on service activities connected with the country's
  strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa.
  Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
  international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural
  resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent
  on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
  development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a
  major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last
  five years because of recession and a high population growth rate (including
  immigrants and refugees).

*Dominican Republic, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is largely dependent on trade; imported components average 60%
  of the value of goods consumed in the domestic market. Rapid growth of free
  trade zones has established a significant expansion of manufacturing for
  export, especially wearing apparel. Over the past decade, tourism has also
  increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign exchange and a
  source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. The
  principal commercial crop is sugarcane, followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa,
  and tobacco. Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural
  products, oil refining, minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is officially
  reported at about 30%, but there is considerable underemployment.

*Ecuador, Economy

Overview:
  Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas. Growth
  has been uneven because of natural disasters, fluctuations in global oil
  prices, and government policies designed to curb inflation. Banana exports,
  second only to oil, have suffered as a result of EC import quotas and banana
  blight. The new President Sixto DURAN-BALLEN, has a much more favorable
  attitude toward foreign investment than did his predecessor. Ecuador has
  implemented trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Venezuela and
  has applied for GATT membership. At the end of 1991, Ecuador received a
  standby IMF loan of $105 million, which will permit the country to proceed
  with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt. In September 1992, the government
  launched a new, macroeconomic program that gives more play to market forces;
  as of March 1993, the program seemed to be paying off.

*Egypt, Economy

Overview:
  Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
  economies, most industrial plants being owned by the government.
  Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment.
  Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but
  in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
  debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
  balance-of-payments support. Egypt's first IMF standby arrangement concluded
  in mid-1987 was suspended in early 1988 because of the government's failure
  to adopt promised reforms. Egypt signed a follow-on program with the IMF and
  also negotiated a structural adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991. In
  1991-92 the government made solid progress on administrative reforms such as
  liberalizing exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major
  structural reforms like streamlining the public sector. As a result, the
  economy has not gained momentum and unemployment has become a growing
  problem. In 1992-93 tourism has plunged 20% or so because of sporadic
  attacks by Islamic extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited
  population growth as the main cause of the country's economic troubles. The
  addition of about 1.4 million people a year to the already huge population
  of 60 million exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the land area available
  for agriculture.

*Equatorial Guinea, Economy

Overview:
  The economy, devastated during the regime of former President Macias NGUEMA,
  is based on agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which account for about half
  of GDP and nearly all exports. Subsistence agriculture predominates, with
  cocoa, coffee, and wood products providing income, foreign exchange, and
  government revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts for about
  8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for about
  38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese,
  uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place under concessions
  offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately successful.
  Increased production from recently discovered natural gas deposits will
  provide a greater share of exports by 1995.

*Eritrea, Economy

Overview:
  With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea faces the bitter
  economic problems of a small, desperately poor African country. Most of the
  population will continue to depend on subsistence farming. Domestic output
  is substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad. Government
  revenues come from custom duties and income and sales taxes. Eritrea has
  inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term prospects for
  revenues from the devlopment of offshore oil, offshore fishing and tourist
  development. For the time being, Ethiopia will be largely dependent on
  Eritrean ports for its foreign trade.

*Estonia, Economy

Overview:
  As of June 1993 Estonia ranks first among the 15 former Soviet republics in
  moving from its obsolete command economy to a modern market economy. Yet
  serious problems remain. In contrast to the estimated 30% drop in output in
  1992, GDP should grow by a small percent in 1993. Of key importance has been
  the introduction of the kroon in August 1993 and the subsequent reductions
  in inflation to 1%-2% per month. Starting in July 1991, under a new law on
  private ownership, small enterprises, such as retail shops and restaurants,
  were sold to private owners. The auctioning of large-scale enterprises is
  progressing with the proceeds being held in escrow until the prior ownership
  (that is, Estonian or the Commonwealth of Independent States) can be
  established. Estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the former
  Soviet republics. Agriculture is well developed, especially meat production,
  and provides a surplus for export. Only about one-fifth of the work force is
  in agriculture. The major share of the work force engages in manufacturing
  both capital and consumer goods based on raw materials and intermediate
  products from the other former Soviet republics. These manufactures are of
  high quality by ex-Soviet standards and are exported to the other republics.
  Estonia's mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil (60%
  of the old Soviet total) and phosphorites (400 million tons). Estonia has a
  large, relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy
  needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants. It has advantages in the
  transition, not having suffered so long under the Soviet yoke and having
  better chances of developing profitable ties to the Nordic and West European
  countries. Like Latvia, but unlike Lithuania, the large portion of ethnic
  Russians (30%) in the population poses still another difficulty in the
  transition to an independent market economy.

  With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993, Ethiopia continues to
  face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest and least developed
  countries in Africa. (The accompanying analysis and figures predate the
  independence of Eritrea.) Its economy is based on subsistence agriculture,
  which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total
  employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The manufacturing
  sector is heavily dependent on inputs from the agricultural sector. Over 90%
  of large-scale industry, but less than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the
  government is considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants.
  Favorable agricultural weather largely explains the 4.5% growth in output in
  FY89, whereas drought and deteriorating internal security conditions
  prevented growth in FY90. In 1991 the lack of law and order, particularly in
  the south, interfered with economic development and growth. In 1992, because
  of some easing of civil strife and aid from the outside world, the economy
  substantially improved.

*Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), Economy

Overview:
  The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or indirectly employs
  most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic
  consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily those
  for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to
  the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
  surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So far,
  efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In
  1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
  operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees
  amount to more than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income
  for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
  Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant
  wildlife and trout fishing.

*Faroe Islands, Economy

Overview:
  The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living standards of the
  Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the
  all-important fishing industry and one of the world's heaviest per capita
  external debts of nearly $30,000. When the nations of the world extended
  their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no
  longer could continue their traditional long-distance fishing and
  subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas. The government's tight
  controls on fish stocks and its austerity measures have caused a recession,
  and subsidy cuts will force nationalization in the fishing industry, which
  has already been plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to
  withhold its annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly one-third of the
  islands' budget revenues - unless the Faroese make significant efforts to
  balance their budget. To this extent the Faroe government is expected to
  continue its tough policies, including introducing a 20% VAT in 1993, and
  has agreed to an IMF economic-political stabilization plan. In addition to
  its annual subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out the second largest
  Faroe bank to the tune of $140 million since October 1992.

*Fiji, Economy

Overview:
  Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large subsistence sector.
  Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange, and sugar processing
  accounts for one-third of industrial output. Industry, including sugar
  milling, contributes 13% to GDP. Fiji traditionally had earned considerable
  sums of hard currency from the 250,000 tourists who visited each year. In
  1987, however, after two military coups, the economy went into decline. GDP
  dropped by 7.8% in 1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political uncertainty
  created a drop in tourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar
  production to fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong
  performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1990 the
  economy received a setback from cyclone Sina, which cut sugar output by an
  estimated 21%. Sugar exports recovered in 1991-92.

*Finland, Economy

Overview:
  Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market economy, with per
  capita output two-thirds of the US figure. Its key economic sector is
  manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and engineering industries.
  Trade is important, with the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP.
  Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw
  materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of
  the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining
  self-sufficiency in basic products. The economy, which experienced an
  average of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989, sank into deep
  recession in 1991 as growth contracted by 6.5%. The recession - which
  continued in 1992 with growth contracting by 3.5% - has been caused by
  economic overheating, depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the
  barter system between Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet
  oil and gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish
  Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and
  efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public
  expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and changes in
  monetary policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the EC's
  European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote stability. Ongoing speculation
  resulting from a lack of confidence in the government's policies forced
  Helsinki to devalue the markka by about 12% in November 1991 and to
  indefinitely break the link in September 1992. By boosting the
  competitiveness of Finnish exports, these measures presumably have kept the
  economic downturn from being even more severe. Unemployment probably will
  remain a serious problem during the next few years - monthly figures in
  early 1993 are approaching 20% - with the majority of Finnish firms facing a
  weak domestic market and the troubled German and Swedish export markets.
  Declining revenues, increased transfer payments, and extensive funding to
  bail out the banking system are expected to push the central government's
  budget deficit to nearly 13% in 1993. Helsinki continues to harmonize its
  economic policies with those of the EC during Finland's current EC
  membership bid.

*France, Economy

Overview:
  One of the world's most developed economies, France has substantial
  agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector.
  Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and
  subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in
  Western Europe. France is largely self-sufficient in agricultural products
  and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector
  generates about one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has
  become crucial to the economy. The French economy is entering its fourth
  consecutive year of sluggish growth after a strong expansion in the late
  1980s. Growth averaged only 1.3% in 1990-92 and is expected to drop to
  between zero and -0.5% in 1993. The government budget deficit rose to 3.2%
  of GDP in 1992 and is expected to be far larger than planned in the 1993
  budget. Paris remains committed to maintaining the franc-deutsch mark
  parity, which has kept French interest rates high despite France's low
  inflation. Although the pace of economic integration within the European
  Community has slowed down, integration presumably will remain a major force
  shaping the fortunes of the various economic sectors.

*French Guiana, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and imports.
  Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most
  important economic activities, with exports of fish and fish products
  (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 1987. The
  large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an
  expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation
  of crops - rice, cassava, bananas, and sugarcane - is limited to the coastal
  area, where the population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily
  dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem,
  particularly among younger workers.

*Gabon, Economy

Overview:
  The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until the early 1970s, is now
  dominated by the oil sector. In 1981-85, oil accounted for about 45% of GDP,
  80% of export earnings, and 65% of government revenues on average. The high
  oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial increase in per
  capita national income, stimulated domestic demand, reinforced migration
  from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real wages to among the
  highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The subsequent slide of Gabon's economy,
  which began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989-90, but
  debt servicing obligations continue to limit prospects for further domestic
  development. Real growth in 1991-92 was weak because of a combination of an
  overstaffed bureaucracy, a large budget deficit, and the continued
  underdevelopment of the whole economy outside the petroleum sector.

*The Gambia, Economy

Overview:
  The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural resources and has a
  limited agricultural base. It is one of the world's poorest countries with a
  per capita income of about $325. About 75% of the population is engaged in
  crop production and livestock raising, which contribute 30% to GDP.
  Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing peanuts, fish, and hides -
  accounts for less than 10% of GDP. Tourism is a growing industry. The Gambia
  imports one-third of its food, all fuel, and most manufactured goods.
  Exports are concentrated on peanut products (about 75% of total value).

*Gaza Strip, Header

Note:
  The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
  control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
  Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David accords and reaffirmed by
  President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the
  West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
  peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
  concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
  resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
  it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
  has yet to be determined. In the US view, the term West Bank describes all
  of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before
  the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the
  framework agreement, however, it is US policy that a distinction must be
  made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's
  special status and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the
  final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the
  rest of the West Bank.

*Gaza Strip, Economy

Overview:
  In 1990 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by
  Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker
  remittances accounting for about one-third of GNP. The construction,
  agricultural, and industrial sectors account for about 15%, 12%, and 8% of
  GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon Israel for some 90% of its external
  trade. Unrest in the territory in 1988-93 (intifadah) has raised
  unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The
  Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza
  since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged,
  unemployment has increased, and exports have fallen dramatically. The area's
  economic outlook remains bleak.

*Georgia, Economy

Overview:
  Among the former Soviet republics, Georgia has been noted for its Black Sea
  tourist industry, its large output of citrus fruits and tea, and an
  industrial sector that accounted, however, for less than 2% of the USSR's
  output. Another salient characteristic of the economy has been a flourishing
  private sector (compared with the other republics). About 25% of the labor
  force is employed in agriculture. Mineral resources consist of manganese and
  copper, and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury.
  Except for very small quantities of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must
  be imported from neighboring republics. Oil and its products have been
  delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to the port of Batumi for export and
  local refining. Gas has been supplied in pipelines from Krasnodar and
  Stavropol'. The dismantling of central economic controls has been delayed by
  political factionalism, marked by bitter armed struggles. In early 1993 the
  Georgian economy was operating at well less than half capacity due to
  disruptions in fuel supplies and vital transportation links as a result of
  conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, antigovernment activity in Western
  Georgia, and Azerbaijani pressure against Georgian assistance for Armenia.
  To restore economic viability, Georgia must establish domestic peace and
  must maintain economic ties to the other former Soviet republics while
  developing new links to the West.

*Germany, Economy

Overview:
  With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, prospects seemed
  bright for a fairly rapid incorporation of East Germany into the highly
  successful West German economy. The Federal Republic, however, continues to
  experience difficulties in integrating and modernizing eastern Germany, and
  the tremendous costs of unification have sunk western Germany deeper into
  recession. The western German economy grew by less than 1% in 1992 as the
  Bundesbank set high interest rates to offset the inflationary effects of
  large government deficits and high wage settlements. Eastern Germany grew by
  6.8% in 1992 but this was from a shrunken base. Despite government transfers
  to the east amounting to nearly $110 billion annually, a self-sustaining
  economy in the region is still some years away. The bright spots are eastern
  Germany's construction, transportation, telecommunications, and service
  sectors, which have experienced strong growth. Western Germany has an
  advanced market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly
  urbanized and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards,
  abundant leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western
  Germany is relatively poor in natural resources, coal being the most
  important mineral. Western Germany's world-class companies manufacture
  technologically advanced goods. The region's economy is mature: services and
  manufacturing account for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw
  materials and semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports.
  In recent years, manufacturing has accounted for about 31% of GDP, with
  other sectors contributing lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1992
  accounted for about 21.5% of GDP. GDP in the western region is now $20,000
  per capita, or 85% of US per capita GDP. Eastern Germany's economy appears
  to be changing from one anchored on manufacturing into a more
  service-oriented economy. The German government, however, is intent on
  maintaining a manufacturing base in the east and is considering a policy for
  subsidizing industrial cores in the region. Eastern Germany's share of
  all-German GDP is only 7% and eastern productivity is just 30% that of the
  west even though eastern wages are at roughly 70% of western levels. The
  privatization agency for eastern Germany, Treuhand, has privatized more than
  four-fifths of the almost 12,000 firms under its control and will likely
  wind down operations in 1994. Private investment in the region continues to
  be lackluster, resulting primarily from the deepening recession in western
  Germany and excessively high eastern wages. Eastern Germany has one of the
  world's largest reserves of low-grade lignite coal but little else in the
  way of mineral resources. The quality of statistics from eastern Germany is
  improving, yet many gaps remain; the federal government began producing
  all-German data for select economic statistics at the start of 1992. The
  most challenging economic problem is promoting eastern Germany's economic
  reconstruction - specifically, finding the right mix of fiscal, monetary,
  regulatory, and tax policies that will spur investment in eastern Germany -
  without destabilizing western Germany's economy or damaging relations with
  West European partners. The government hopes a "solidarity pact" among labor
  unions, business, state governments, and the SPD opposition will provide the
  right mix of wage restraints, investment incentives, and spending cuts to
  stimulate eastern recovery. Finally, the homogeneity of the German economic
  culture has been changed by the admission of large numbers of immigrants.

*Ghana, Economy

Overview:
  Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been
  implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including
  moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily
  dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not
  spread substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending
  peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
  democratic government have boosted government expenditures and undercut
  structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in 1990.
  Meanwhile, declining world commodity prices for Ghana's exports has placed
  the government under severe financial pressure.

*Greece, Economy

Overview:
  Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic entrepreneurial system
  overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist system that enlarged the public sector
  from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% when Prime Minister MITSOTAKIS took
  office. Tourism continues as a major source of foreign exchange, and
  agriculture is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal
  feedstuffs. Since 1986, real GDP growth has averaged only 1.6% a year,
  compared with the Europen Community average of 3%. The MITSOTAKIS government
  has made little progress during its two and one-half years in power in
  coming to grips with Greece's main economic problems: an inflation rate
  still four times the EC average, a large public sector deficit, and a
  fragile current account position. In early 1991, the government secured a
  three-year, $2.5 billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest
  terms yet imposed on a member country, as the EC finally ran out of patience
  with Greece's failure to put its financial affairs in order. On the advice
  of the EC Commission, Greece delayed applying for the second installment
  until 1993 because of the failure of the government to meet the 1992
  targets. Although MITSOTAKIS faced down the unions in mid-1992 in a dispute
  over privatization plans, social security reform, and tax and price
  increases, and his new economics czar, Stephanos MANOS, is a respected
  economist committed to renovating the ailing economy. However, a national
  elections due by May 1994 will probably prompt MITSOTAKIS to backtrack on
  economic reform. In 1993, the GDP growth rate likely will remain low; the
  inflation rate probably will continue to fall, while remaining the highest
  in the EC.

*Greenland, Economy

Overview:
  Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult and unemployment
  increases. Prospects for economic growth in the immediate future are not
  bright. The Home Rule Government's economic restraint measures introduced in
  the late 1980s have assisted in shifting red figures into a balance in the
  public budget. Foreign trade produced a surplus in 1989 and 1990, but has
  now returned to a deficit. Following the closing of the Black Angel lead and
  zinc mine in 1989, Greenland today is fully dependent on fishing and fish
  processing, this sector accounting for 95% of exports. Prospects for
  fisheries are not bright, as the important shrimp catches will at best
  stabilize and cod catches have dropped. Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon
  activities is not around the corner, thus leaving only tourism with some
  potential for the near future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e. the HRG
  and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in
  Greenland accounting for about two thirds of total employment. About half
  the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish Government.

*Grenada, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is essentially agricultural and centers on the traditional
  production of spices and tropical plants. Agriculture accounts for about 16%
  of GDP and 80% of exports and employs 24% of the labor force. Tourism is the
  leading foreign exchange earner, followed by agricultural exports.
  Manufacturing remains relatively undeveloped, but is expected to grow, given
  a more favorable private investment climate since 1983. The economy achieved
  an impressive average annual growth rate of 5.5% in 1986-91 but stalled in
  1992. Unemployment remains high at about 25%.

*Guadeloupe, Economy

Overview:
  The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services.
  It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. Tourism is
  a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly
  large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important
  sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas
  (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers.
  Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption,
  although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly
  from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production.
  Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
  high among the young.

*Guyana, Economy

Overview:
  Guyana is one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita income less
  than one-fifth the South American average. After growing on average at less
  than 1% a year in 1986-87, GDP dropped by 5% a year in 1988-90. The decline
  resulted from bad weather, labor trouble in the cane fields, and flooding
  and equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about
  100% in 1989 and 75% in 1990, and the current account deficit widened
  substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric power
  has been in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in
  national output. The government, in association with international financial
  agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds. The
  government's stabilization program - aimed at establishing realistic
  exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of growth -
  requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience
  by consumers during a long incubation period. Buoyed by a recovery in mining
  and agriculture, the economy posted 6% growth in 1991 and 7% growth in 1992,
  according to official figures. A large volume of illegal and quasi-legal
  economic activity is not captured in estimates of the country's total
  output.

*Haiti, Economy

Overview:
  About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is mainly
  small-scale subsistence farming and employs nearly three-fourths of the work
  force. The majority of the population does not have ready access to safe
  drinking water, adequate medical care, or sufficient food. Few social
  assistance programs exist, and the lack of employment opportunities remains
  one of the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil
  erosion and political instability. Trade sanctions applied by the
  Organization of American States in response to the September 1991 coup
  against President ARISTIDE have further damaged the economy.

*Honduras, Economy

Overview:
  Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
  Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for more
  than 25% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces two-thirds of
  exports. Productivity remains low. Industry, still in its early stages,
  employs nearly 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15% of GDP, and generates
  20% of exports. The service sectors, including public administration,
  account for 50% of GDP and employ nearly 20% of the labor force. Basic
  problems facing the economy include rapid population growth, high
  unemployment, a lack of basic services, a large and inefficient public
  sector, and the dependence of the export sector mostly on coffee and
  bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations. A far-reaching
  reform program initiated by President CALLEJAS in 1990 is beginning to take
  hold.

*Hong Kong, Economy

Overview:
  Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or nontariff
  barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be
  imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18% of GDP, employs 28% of the
  labor force, and exports about 90% of its output. Real GDP growth averaged a
  remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2%
  in 1991 and 5.9% in 1992. Unemployment, which has been declining since the
  mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put upward
  pressure on prices and the cost of living. Short-term prospects remain
  bright so long as major trading partners continue to be reasonably

*Hungary, Economy

Overview:
  Hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition from a command to a market
  economy. Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable export
  earnings and meeting domestic food needs. Industry accounts for about 40% of
  GDP and 30% of employment. Hungary claims that less than 25% of foreign
  trade is now with former CEMA countries, while about 70% is with OECD
  members. Hungary's economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it
  a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment.
  In 1991, Hungary received 60% of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe,
  and in 1992 received the largest single share. The growing private sector
  accounts for about one-third of national output according to unofficial
  estimates. Privatization of state enterprises is progressing, although
  excessive red tape, bureaucratic oversight, and uncertainties about pricing
  have slowed the process. Escalating unemployment and high rates of inflation
  may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform, while
  Hungary's heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to introduce
  full convertibility of the forint before 1994 and to rein in inflation. The
  government is projecting an end to the 5-year recession in 1993, and GDP is
  forecast to grow 0%-3%.

*Iceland, Economy

Overview:
  Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic, but with an
  extensive welfare system, relatively low unemployment, and comparatively
  even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
  industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings and employs 12% of
  the workforce. In the absence of other natural resources - except energy -
  Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. Iceland's
  economy has been in recession since 1988. The recession deepened in 1992 due
  to severe cutbacks in fishing quotas and falling world prices for the
  country's main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon.
  Real GDP declined 3.3% in 1992 and is forecast to contract another 1.5% in
  1993. The center-right government's economic goals include reducing the
  budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing
  inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the
  economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The recession has led to a
  wave of bankruptcies and mergers throughout the economy, as well as the
  highest unemployment of the post-World War II period. The national
  unemployment rate reached 5% in early 1993, with some parts of the country
  experiencing unemployment in the 9-10% range. Inflation, previously a
  serious problem, declined from double digit rates in the 1980s to only 3.7%
  in 1992.

*India, Economy

Overview:
  India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming, modern
  agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude
  of support services. Faster economic growth in the 1980s permitted a
  significant increase in real per capita private consumption. A large share
  of the population, perhaps as much as 40%, remains too poor to afford an
  adequate diet. Financial strains in 1990 and 1991 prompted government
  austerity measures that slowed industrial growth but permitted India to meet
  its international payment obligations without rescheduling its debt. Policy
  reforms since 1991 have extended earlier economic liberalization and greatly
  reduced government controls on production, trade, and investment.

*Indian Ocean, Economy

Overview:
  The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the Middle East,
  Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It carries a
  particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from the oil
  fields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing
  importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export.
  Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian
  Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being
  tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western
  Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes
  from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore
  placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly
  India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries:
  based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,
  minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel aggregates,
  placer deposits

*Indonesia, Economy

Overview:
  Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
  planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise.
  Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly
  increasing population, it remains a poor country. Real GDP growth in 1985-92
  averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash
  underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the
  labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important
  sector, accounting for almost 20% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force.
  The staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia
  is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and
  textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
  generation. Industrial output now accounts for almost 40% of GDP and is
  based on a supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural
  gas, timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates the
  external economy, generating more than 20% of the government's revenues and
  40% of export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's growth is highly
  dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan remains
  Indonesia's most important customer and supplier of aid. Rapid growth in the
  money supply in 1989-90 prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary
  policy in 1991, forcing the private sector to go to foreign banks for
  investment financing. Real interest rates remained above 10% and off-shore
  commercial debt grew. The growth in off-shore debt prompted Jakarta to limit
  foreign borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the continued problems in
  moving toward a more open financial system and the persistence of a fairly
  tight credit situation, GDP growth in 1992 is estimated to have stayed at
  6%.

*Iran, Economy

Overview:
  Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and
  other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private
  trading and service ventures. After a decade of economic decline, Iran's
  real GDP grew by 10% in FY90 and 6% in FY91, according to Iranian Government
  statistics. An oil windfall in 1990 combined with a substantial increase in
  imports contributed to Iran's recent economic growth. Iran has also begun
  implementing a number of economic reforms to reduce government intervention
  (including subsidies) and has allocated substantial resources to development
  projects in the hope of stimulating the economy. Lower oil revenues in 1991
  - oil accounts for more than 90% of export revenues - together with a surge
  in imports greatly weakened Iran's international financial position. By
  mid-1992 Iran was unable to meet its obligations to foreign creditors.
  Subsequently the government has tried to boost oil exports, curb imports
  (especially of consumer goods), and renegotiate terms of its foreign debts.

*Iraq, Economy

Overview:
  The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central planning and management of
  industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some small-scale
  industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise. The
  economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which has traditionally
  provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial
  problems caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and
  damage to oil export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement
  austerity measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt
  payments. After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually
  increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
  facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages,
  salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land reform and
  collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high
  priority by the government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's
  seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international economic
  embargoes, and military action by an international coalition beginning in
  January 1991 drastically changed the economic picture. Industrial and
  transportation facilities suffered severe damage and have been only
  partially restored. Oil exports remain at less than 10% of the previous
  level. Shortages of spare parts continue. Living standards deteriorated even
  further in 1992 and early 1993; consumer prices at least tripled in 1992.
  The UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and imports and has
  contributed to the sharp rise in prices. The government's policies of
  supporting large military and internal security forces and of allocating
  resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated shortages. In
  brief, per capita output in early 1993 is far below the 1989-90 level, but
  no reliable estimate is available.

*Ireland, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is small and trade dependent. Agriculture, once the most
  important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37% of GDP,
  about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor force. Since 1987, real
  GDP growth, led by exports, has averaged 4% annually. Over the same period,
  inflation has fallen sharply and chronic trade deficits have been
  transformed into annual surpluses. Unemployment, at 22.7% remains a serious
  problem, however, and job creation is the main focus of government policy.
  To ease unemployment, Dublin aggressively courts foreign investors and
  recently created a new industrial development agency to aid small indigenous
  firms. Government assistance is constrained by Dublin's continuing deficit
  reduction measures. After five years of fiscal restraint, total government
  debt still exceeds GDP. Growth probably will moderate in 1993 as the heavily
  indebted and trade-dependent economy is highly sensitive to changes in
  exchange rates and world interest rates. Exports to the UK, Ireland's major
  export market, probably will be hurt by the recent appreciation of the Irish
  currency against sterling - for the first time since 1979 the value of the
  Irish pound exceeds that of its British counterpart.

Note:
  The Arab territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included
  in the data below. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed
  by President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of
  the West Bank and Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
  peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
  concerned parties. The Camp David Accords further specify that these
  negotiations will resolve the location of the respective boundaries. Pending
  the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of the
  West Bank and Gaza Strip has yet to be determined (see West Bank and Gaza
  Strip entries). On 25 April 1982, Israel relinquished control of the Sinai
  to Egypt. Statistics for the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are included in
  the Syria entry.

*Israel, Economy

Overview:
  Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation. It
  depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military
  equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively
  developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.
  Industry employs about 20% of Israeli workers, agriculture 5%, and services
  most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural
  products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts
  balance-of-payments deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments
  from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's $17
  billion external debt is owed to the United States, which is its major
  source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel
  has been targeting high-technology niches in international markets, such as
  medical scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former
  USSR, which topped 400,000 during the period 1990-92, has increased
  unemployment, intensified housing problems, and widened the government
  budget deficit. At the same time, a considerable number of the immigrants
  bring to the economy valuable scientific and professional expertise.

*Italy, Economy

Overview:
  Since World War II the economy has changed from one based on agriculture
  into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the same total and per
  capita output as France and the UK. The country is still divided into a
  developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and an
  undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public enterprises.
  Services account for 48% of GDP, industry 35%, agriculture 4%, and public
  administration 13%. Most raw materials needed by industry and over 75% of
  energy requirements must be imported. After growing at an annual average
  rate of 3% in 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and 1992. In the
  second half of 1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying
  to participate in EC plans for economic and monetary union later in the
  decade; thus it finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances. Thanks
  to the determination of Prime Minister AMATO, the government adopted a
  fairly stringent budget for 1993, abandoned its highly inflationary wage
  indexation system, and started to scale back its extremely generous social
  welfare programs, including pension and health care benefits. Monetary
  officials, who were forced to withdraw the lira from the European monetary
  system in September 1992 when it came under extreme pressure in currency
  markets, remain committed to bringing the currency back into the grid as
  soon as conditions warrant. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of
  refurbishing a tottering communications system, curbing pollution in major
  industrial centers, and adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying
  the ongoing economic integration of the European Community.

*Jamaica, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is based on sugar, bauxite, and tourism. In 1985 it suffered a
  setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina
  industry, a major source of hard currency earnings. Since 1986 an economic
  recovery has been under way. In 1987 conditions began to improve for the
  bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices. The
  recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and tourism
  sectors. In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on
  crops and the electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the
  economy. By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was
  largely complete, and real growth was up about 3% for 1989. In 1991,
  however, growth dropped to 0.2% as a result of the US recession, lower world
  bauxite prices, and monetary instability. In 1992, growth was 1.5%,
  supported by a recovery in tourism and stabilization of the Jamaican dollar
  in the second half of 1992.

*Japan, Economy

Overview:
  Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, and a comparatively
  small defense allocation have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
  rapidity, notably in high-technology fields. Industry, the most important
  sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
  fuels. Self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its
  requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the
  world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global
  catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the
  1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic growth slowed markedly
  in 1992 largely because of contractionary domestic policies intended to
  wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. At the
  same time, the stronger yen and slower global growth are containing export
  growth. Unemployment and inflation remain low at 2%. Japan continues to run
  a huge trade surplus - $107 billion in 1992, up nearly 40% from the year
  earlier - which supports extensive investment in foreign assets. The
  crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its population are two
  major long-run problems.

*Jersey, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and
  tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are
  important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy
  cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk
  products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector
  overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the
  island's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light
  industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry
  has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw
  material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
  Jersey's food needs.

*Jordan, Economy

Overview:
  Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the late
  1970s and early 1980s, when its annual GNP growth averaged more than 10%. In
  the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in both Arab aid and worker
  remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly 2% per year.
  Imports - mainly oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food - have been
  outstripping exports, with the difference covered by aid, remittances, and
  borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling
  negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually
  reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The
  Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated Jordan's
  already serious economic problems, forcing the government to shelve the IMF
  program, stop most debt payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid
  from Gulf Arab states and worker remittances have plunged, and refugees have
  flooded the country, straining government resources. Economic recovery is
  unlikely without substantial foreign aid, debt relief, and economic reform.

*Kazakhstan, Economy

Overview:
  The second-largest in area of the 15 former Soviet republics, Kazakhstan has
  vast oil, coal, and agricultural resources. Kazakhstan is highly dependent
  on trade with Russia, exchanging its natural resources for finished consumer
  and industrial goods. Kazakhstan now finds itself with serious pollution
  problems, backward technology, and little experience in foreign markets. The
  government in 1992 continued to push privatization of the economy and freed
  many prices. Output in 1992 dropped because of problems common to the
  ex-Soviet Central Asian republics, especially the cumulative effects of the
  disruption of old supply channels and the slow process of creating new
  economic institutions. Kazakhstan lacks the funds, technology, and
  managerial skills for a quick recovery of output. US firms have been
  enlisted to increase oil output but face formidable obstacles; for example,
  oil can now reach Western markets only through pipelines that run across
  independent former Soviet republics. Finally, the end of monolithic
  Communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open. The 6 million
  Russians in the republic, formerly the favored class, now face the hostility
  of a society dominated by Muslims. Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the
  formidable obstacles to the prioritization of national objectives and the
  creation of a productive, technologically advancing society.

*Kenya, Economy

Overview:
  Kenya's 3.6% annual population growth rate - one of the highest in the world
  - presents a serious problem for the country's economy. In the meantime, GDP
  growth in the near term has kept slightly ahead of population - annually
  averaging 4.9% in the 1986-90 period. Undependable weather conditions and a
  shortage of arable land hamper long-term growth in agriculture, the leading
  economic sector. In 1991, deficient rainfall, stagnant export volume, and
  sagging export prices held economic growth below the all-important
  population growth figure, and in 1992 output fell.

  crops - coffee, tea, sisal, pineapple; food products - corn, wheat,
  sugarcane, fruit, vegetables, dairy products, beef, pork, poultry, eggs;
  food output not keeping pace with population growth, and crop production has
  been extended into marginal land

*Kiribati, Economy

Overview:
  The country has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
  deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish
  now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated
  widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 8% in 1987, as the fish
  catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986 and copra production
  was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded strongly in 1988, with real
  GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in economic growth came from an increase in
  copra production and a good fish catch. Following the strong surge in output
  in 1988, GNP increased 1% in both 1989 and 1990.

*Korea, North, Economy

Overview:
  More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; agricultural land is
  collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured goods.
  State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist
  country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the
  strict rule of KIM Il-song and his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during
  the period 1984-88 averaged 2-3%, but output declined by 3-5% annually
  during 1989-92 because of systemic problems and disruptions in
  socialist-style economic relations with the former USSR and China. In 1992,
  output dropped sharply, by perhaps 10-15%, as the economy felt the
  cumulative effect of the reduction in outside support. The leadership
  insisted in maintaining its high level of military outlays from a shrinking
  economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in inventories and critical
  shortages in the energy sector have led to increasing interruptions in
  industrial production. Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have formed
  the basis of industrial development since WWII. Output of the extractive
  industries includes coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead,
  and precious metals. Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry, including
  military industry, with light industry lagging far behind. Despite the use
  of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of
  fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become self-sufficient in food
  production. Five consecutive years of poor harvests, coupled with
  distribution problems, have led to chronic food shortages. North Korea
  remains far behind South Korea in economic development and living standards.

*Korea, South, Economy

Overview:
  The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth has been the planned
  development of an export-oriented economy in a vigorously entrepreneurial
  society. Real GNP increased more than 10% annually between 1986 and 1991.
  This growth ultimately led to an overheated situation characterized by a
  tight labor market, strong inflationary pressures, and a rapidly rising
  current account deficit. As a result, in 1992, focusing attention on slowing
  the growth rate of inflation and reducing the deficit is leading to a
  slow-down in growth. The economy remains the envy of the great majority of
  the world's peoples.

*Kuwait, Economy

Overview:
  Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with proven crude oil reserves
  of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world reserves. Kuwait is rebuilding
  its war-ravaged petroleum sector and the increase in crude oil production to
  nearly 2.0 million barrels per day by the end of 1992 led to an enormous
  increase in GDP for the year. The government ran a cumulative fiscal deficit
  of approximately $70 billion over its last two fiscal years, reducing its
  foreign asset position and increasing its public debt to roughly $40
  billion. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP and over 90% of export
  and government revenue.

*Kyrgyzstan, Economy

Overview:
  Kyrgyzstan's small economy (less than 1% of the total for the former Soviet
  Union) is oriented toward agriculture, producing mainly livestock such as
  goats and sheep, as well as cotton, grain, and tobacco. Industry,
  concentrated around Bishkek, produces small quantities of electric motors,
  livestock feeding equipment, washing machines, furniture, cement, paper, and
  bricks. Mineral extraction is small, the most important minerals being coal,
  rare earth metals and gold. Kyrgyzstan is a net importer of many types of
  food and fuel but is a net exporter of electricity. In 1992, the Kirghiz
  leadership made progress on reform, primarily by privatizing business,
  granting life-long tenure to farmers, and freeing most prices. Nonetheless,
  in 1992 overall industrial and livestock output declined because of acute
  fuel shortages and a widespread lack of spare parts.

*Laos, Economy

Overview:
  One of the world's poorest nations, Laos has had a Communist centrally
  planned economy with government ownership and control of productive
  enterprises of any size. In recent years, however, the government has been
  decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a
  landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure; that is, it has no
  railroads, a rudimentary road system, limited external and internal
  telecommunications, and electricity available in only a limited area.
  Subsistence agriculture is the main occupation, accounting for over 60% of
  GDP and providing about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is
  rice. For the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend for its
  survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources; aid
  from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.

*Latvia, Economy

Overview:
  Latvia is in the process of reforming the centrally planned economy
  inherited from the former USSR into a market economy. Prices have been
  freed, and privatization of shops and farms has begun. Latvia lacks natural
  resources, aside from its arable land and small forests. Its most valuable
  economic asset is its work force, which is better educated and disciplined
  than in most of the former Soviet republics. Industrial production is highly
  diversified, with products ranging from agricultural machinery to consumer
  electronics. One conspicuous vulnerability: Latvia produces only 10% of its
  electric power needs. Latvia in the near term must retain key commercial
  ties to Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine while moving in the long run toward
  joint ventures with technological support from, and trade ties to the West.
  Because of the efficiency of its mostly individual farms, Latvians enjoy a
  diet that is higher in meat, vegetables, and dairy products and lower in
  grain and potatoes than diets in the 12 non-Baltic republics of the former
  USSR. Good relations with Russia are threatened by animosity between ethnic
  Russians (34% of the population) and native Latvians. The cumulative
  difficulties in replacing old sources of supply and old markets, together
  with the phasing out of the Russian ruble as the medium of exchange, help
  account for the sharp 30% drop in GDP in 1992.

*Lebanon, Header

Note:
  Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions and
  regaining its national sovereignty since the end of the devastating 16-year
  civil war in October 1990. Under the Ta'if accord - the blueprint for
  national reconciliation - the Lebanese have established a more equitable
  political system, particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the
  political process. Since December 1990, the Lebanese have formed three
  cabinets and conducted the first legislative election in 20 years. Most of
  the militias have been weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces
  (LAF) has seized vast quantities of weapons used by the militias during the
  war and extended central government authority over about one-half of the
  country. Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, is the only significant group
  that retains most of its weapons. Foreign forces still occupy areas of
  Lebanon. Israel continues to support a proxy militia, The Army of South
  Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous to its border.
  The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared security zone and about 20
  kilometers north to the strategic town of Jazzine. As of December 1992,
  Syria maintained about 30,000 troops in Lebanon. These troops are based
  mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment
  was legitimized by the Arab League early in Lebanon's civil war and in the
  Ta'if accord. Citing the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests,
  and failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the
  constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far refused to
  withdraw its troops from Beirut.

*Lebanon, Economy

Overview:
  Since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged Lebanon's economic
  infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's
  position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. Following October
  1990, however, a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin
  restoring control in Beirut, collect taxes, and regain access to key port
  and government facilities. The battered economy has also been propped up by
  a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale
  manufacturers. Family remittances, banking transactions, manufactured and
  farm exports, the narcotics trade, and international emergency aid are main
  sources of foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year of 1991,
  industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed substantial
  gains. The further rebuilding of the war-ravaged country was delayed in 1992
  because of an upturn in political wrangling. Hope for restoring economic
  momentum in 1993 rests with the new, business-oriented Prime Minister
  HARIRI.

*Lesotho, Economy

Overview:
  Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
  resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light
  manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa ($439
  million in 1991). The great majority of households gain their livelihoods
  from subsistence farming and migrant labor. Manufacturing depends largely on
  farm products to support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries;
  other industries include textile, clothing, and construction (in particular,
  a major water improvement project which will permit the sale of water to
  South Africa). Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989.
  Political and economic instability in South Africa raises uncertainty for
  Lesotho's economy, especially with respect to migrant worker remittances -
  recently the equivalent of nearly three-fourths of domestic output.

*Liberia, Economy

Overview:
  Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the
  infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Businessmen have fled the country,
  taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return. Richly endowed
  with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to
  agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products,
  while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope.
  Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction and
  repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who have fled to neighboring
  countries. The political impasse between the interim government and rebel
  leader Charles Taylor has prevented restoration of normal economic life,
  including the re-establishment of a strong central government with effective
  economic development programs.

*Libya, Economy

Overview:
  The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil
  sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and about
  one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at
  $5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response
  to changes in the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient
  resource allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs,
  although the reopening of the Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the
  Libyan-Egyptian border in December 1989 have eased shortages. Austerity
  budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the government's
  ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure development
  projects. Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990
  improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current account
  surplus for the first time in five years. The nonoil manufacturing and
  construction sectors, which account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from
  processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals, iron,
  steel, and aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it
  employs about 20% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils
  severely limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food
  requirements.

  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $26.1 billion (1992 est.)

*Liechtenstein, Economy

Overview:
  The prosperous economy is based primarily on small-scale light industry and
  tourism. Industry accounts for 53% of total employment, the service sector
  45% (mostly based on tourism), and agriculture and forestry 2%. The sale of
  postage stamps to collectors is estimated at $10 million annually. Low
  business taxes (the maximum tax rate is 20%) and easy incorporation rules
  have induced about 25,000 holding or so-called letter box companies to
  establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated
  solely for tax purposes, provide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied
  closely to Switzerland's economy in a customs union, and incomes and living
  standards parallel those of the more prosperous Swiss groups.

*Lithuania, Economy

Overview:
  Lithuania is striving to become an independent privatized economy. Although
  it was substantially above average in living standards and technology in the
  old USSR, Lithuania historically lagged behind Latvia and Estonia in
  economic development. The country has no important natural resources aside
  from its arable land and strategic location. Industry depends entirely on
  imported materials that have come from the republics of the former USSR.
  Lithuania benefits from its ice-free port at Klaipeda on the Baltic Sea and
  its rail and highway hub at Vilnius, which provides land communication
  between Eastern Europe and Russia, Latvia, Estonia, and Belarus. Industry
  produces a small assortment of high-quality products, ranging from complex
  machine tools to sophisticated consumer electronics. Because of nuclear
  power, Lithuania is presently self-sufficient in electricity, exporting its
  surplus to Latvia and Belarus; the nuclear facilities inherited from the
  USSR, however, have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in
  safety standards. Agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former
  Soviet Union. Lithuania held first place in per capita consumption of meat,
  second place for eggs and potatoes, and fourth place for milk and dairy
  products. Grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries.
  Lithuania is pressing ahead with plans to privatize at least 60% of
  state-owned property (industry, agriculture, and housing), having already
  sold almost all housing and many small enterprises using a voucher system.
  Other government priorities include encouraging foreign investment by
  protecting the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign
  trade away from Eastern markets to the more competitive Western markets. For
  the moment, Lithuania will remain highly dependent on Russia for energy, raw
  materials, grains, and markets for its products. In 1992, output plummeted
  by 30% because of cumulative problems with inputs and with markets, problems
  that were accentuated by the phasing out of the Russian ruble as the medium
  of exchange.

*Luxembourg, Economy

Overview:   The stable economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and negligible
  unemployment. Agriculture is based on small but highly productive
  family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently dominated by
  steel, has become increasingly more diversified, particularly toward
  high-technology firms. During the past decade, growth in the financial
  sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Services,
  especially banking, account for a growing proportion of the economy.
  Luxembourg participates in an economic union with Belgium on trade and most
  financial matters and is also closely connected economically to the
  Netherlands.

  about two-thirds of export earnings; the gambling industry represented well

*Macedonia, Economy

Overview:
  Macedonia, although the poorest among the six republics of a dissolved
  Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and energy needs through its own
  agricultural and coal resources. It will, however, move down toward a bare
  subsistence level of life unless economic ties are reforged or enlarged with
  its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and Bulgaria. The
  economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas and its modern
  machinery and parts. Continued political turmoil, both internally and in the
  region as a whole, prevents any swift readjustments of trade patterns and
  economic programs. Inflation in early 1992 was out of control, the result of
  fracturing trade links, the decline in economic activity, and general
  uncertainties about the future status of the country; prices rose 38% in
  March 1992 alone. In August 1992, Greece, angry at the use of "Macedonia" as
  the republic's name, imposed a partial blockade for several months. This
  blockade, combined with the effects of the UN sanctions on Serbia and
  Montenegro, cost the economy approximately $1 billion in 1992 according to
  official figures. Macedonia's geographical isolation, technological
  backwardness, and potential political instability place it far down the list
  of countries of interest to Western investors. Resolution of the dispute
  with Greece and an internal commitment to economic reform would help to
  encourage foreign investment over the long run. In the immediate future, the
  worst scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its
  borders.

*Madagascar, Economy

Overview:
  Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. Agriculture,
  including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting
  for over 30% of GDP and contributing to more than 70% of total export
  earnings. Industry is largely confined to the processing of agricultural
  products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted for only 13% of
  GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year development plan that
  stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990, increased
  production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After mid-1991, however,
  output dropped sharply because of protracted antigovernment strikes and
  demonstrations for political reform.

*Malaysia, Economy

Overview:
  The Malaysian economy, a mixture of private enterprise and a soundly managed
  public sector, has posted a remarkable record of 8%-9% average growth in
  1987-92. This growth has resulted in a substantial reduction in poverty and
  a marked rise in real wages. Despite sluggish growth in the major world
  economies in 1992, demand for Malaysian goods remained strong and foreign
  investors continued to commit large sums in the economy. The government is
  aware of the inflationary potential of this rapid development and is closely
  monitoring fiscal and monetary policies.

  source of government revenue. During the 1980s tourism became one of the
  most important and highest growth sectors of the economy. In 1988 industry
  accounted for about 5% of GDP. Real GDP is officially estimated to have
  increased by about 10% annually during the period 1974-90.

*Malta, Economy

Overview:
  Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic location, and a
  productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has
  limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy sources.
  Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on foreign trade and services.
  Manufacturing and tourism are the largest contributors to the economy.
  Manufacturing accounts for about 27% of GDP, with the electronics and
  textile industries major contributors and the state-owned Malta drydocks
  employing about 4,300 people. In 1991, about 900,000 tourists visited the
  island. Per capita GDP at $7,600 places Malta in the middle-income range of
  the world's nations.

*Man, Isle of, Economy

Overview:
  Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the economy.
  The government's policy of offering incentives to high-technology companies
  and financial institutions to locate on the island has paid off in expanding
  employment opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture
  and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in their
  shares of GNP. Banking now contributes over 20% to GNP and manufacturing
  about 15%. Trade is mostly with the UK. The Isle of Man enjoys free access
  to European Community markets.

*Marshall Islands, Economy

Overview:
  Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the economy. Agricultural
  production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important commercial
  crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. A few cattle ranches
  supply the domestic meat market. Small-scale industry is limited to
  handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry is the primary
  source of foreign exchange and employs about 10% of the labor force. The
  islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. In 1987
  the US Government provided grants of $40 million out of the Marshallese
  budget of $55 million.

*Martinique, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and light industry.
  Agriculture accounts for about 10% of GDP and the small industrial sector
  for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used
  for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to
  France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be
  imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
  transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
  agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the
  work force is employed in the service sector and in administration. Banana
  workers launched protests late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and
  fears of greater competition in the European market from other producers.

*Mauritania, Economy

Overview:
  A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for
  a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers
  were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s.
  Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50%
  of total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led
  to cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
  fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens
  this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near
  Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, the droughts, the endemic conflict with
  Senegal, rising energy costs, and economic mismanagement have resulted in a
  substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun the second
  stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the
  IMF, and major donor countries. But the reform process suffered a major
  setback following the Gulf war of early 1991. Because of Mauritania's
  support of SADDAM Husayn, bilateral aid from its two top donors, Saudi
  Arabia and Kuwait, was suspended, and multilateral aid was reduced.

*Mexico, Economy

Overview:
  Mexico's economy is a mixture of state-owned industrial facilities (notably
  oil), private manufacturing and services, and both large-scale and
  traditional agriculture. In the 1980s, Mexico experienced severe economic
  difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as world petroleum
  prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the domestic food supply;
  and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate became more acute.
  Growth in national output, however, has recovered, rising from 1.4% in 1988
  to 4% in 1990 and 3.6% in 1991 and coming in at 2.6% in 1992. The US is
  Mexico's major trading partner, accounting for almost three-quarters of its
  exports and imports. After petroleum, border assembly plants and tourism are
  the largest earners of foreign exchange. The government, in consultation
  with international economic agencies, has been implementing programs to
  stabilize the economy and foster growth. For example, it has privatized more
  than two-thirds of its state-owned companies (parastatals), including banks.
  In 1991-92 the government conducted negotiations with the US and Canada on a
  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was still being discussed
  by the three countries in early 1993. In January 1993, Mexico replaced its
  old peso with a new peso, at the rate of 1,000 old to 1 new peso.
  Notwithstanding the palpable improvements in economic performance in the
  early 1990s, Mexico faces substantial problems for the remainder of the
  decade - e.g., rapid population growth, unemployment, and serious pollution,
  particularly in Mexico City.

*Micronesia, Federated States of, Economy

Overview:
  Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing. The
  islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade
  phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness
  of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development.
  Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the
  US pledged to spend $1 billion in the islands in the l990s. Geographical
  isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to
  long-term growth.

*Moldova, Economy

Overview:
  Moldova, the next-to-smallest of the former Soviet republics in area, is the
  most densely inhabited. Moldova has a little more than 1% of the population,
  labor force, capital stock, and output of the former Soviet Union. Living
  standards have been below average for the European USSR. The country enjoys
  a favorable climate, and economic development has been primarily based on
  agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Industry
  accounts for 20% of the labor force, whereas agriculture employs more than
  one-third. Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on other
  former Soviet republics for coal, oil, gas, steel, most electronic
  equipment, machine tools, and major consumer durables such as automobiles.
  Its industrial and agricultural products, in turn, have been exported to the
  other republics. Moldova has freed prices on most goods and has legalized
  private ownership of property. Moldova's near-term economic prospects are
  dimmed, however, by the difficulties of moving toward a market economy, the
  political problems of redefining ties to the other former Soviet republics
  and Romania, and the ongoing separatist movements in the Dniester and Gagauz
  regions. In 1992, national output fell substantially for the second
  consecutive year - down 22% in the industrial sector and 20% in agriculture.
  The decline is mainly attributable to the drop in energy supplies.

Overview:
  Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular resort,
  attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The Principality has
  successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added,
  nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes
  and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established
  residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices.
  About 50% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,
  banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism.
  Living standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to those in
  prosperous French metropolitan suburbs.

*Mongolia, Economy

Overview:
  Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses of
  unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic activity
  traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock -
  Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world. In
  recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet
  support. The mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin,
  tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial production. Timber
  and fishing are also important sectors. In 1992 the Mongolian leadership
  continued its struggle with severe economic dislocations, mainly
  attributable to the crumbling of the USSR, by far Mongolia's leading trade
  and development partner. Moscow cut almost all aid in 1991, and little was
  provided in 1992. Industry in 1992 was hit hard by energy shortages, mainly
  due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports.
  By the end of the year, the country was perilously close to a complete
  shutdown of its centralized energy supply system, due to critical coal
  shortages. The government is moving away from the Soviet-style, centrally
  planned economy through privatization and price reform.

*Morocco, Economy

Overview:
  The economy had recovered moderately in 1990 because of: the resolution of a
  trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales, a rebound in textile
  sales to the EC, lower prices for food imports, a sharp increase in worker
  remittances, increased Arab donor aid, and generous debt rescheduling
  agreements. Economic performance in 1991 was mixed. A record harvest helped
  real GDP advance by 4.2%. Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial
  policies triggered rapid credit and monetary growth. Despite recovery of
  domestic demand, import volume growth slowed while export volume was
  adversely affected by phosphate marketing difficulties. In January 1992,
  Morocco reached a new 12-month standby arrangement for $129 million with the
  IMF. In February 1992, the Paris Club rescheduled $1.4 billion of Morocco's
  commercial debt. This is thought to be Morocco's last rescheduling. By 1993
  the Moroccan authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service
  obligations without additional rescheduling. Servicing this large debt, high
  unemployment, and Morocco's vulnerability to external economic forces remain
  severe long-term problems. In 1992 Morocco embarked on a program to
  privatize 112 state-owned companies. A severe winter drought in 1991/92 cut
  back agricultural output in 1992.

*Mozambique, Economy

Overview:
  One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to exploit the
  economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and
  transportation resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and
  investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of
  internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a growing
  foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic
  reform policy, resulted in successive years of economic growth in the late
  1980s, but aid has declined steadily since 1989. Agricultural output,
  nevertheless, is at about only 75% of its 1981 level, and grain has to be
  imported. Industry operates at only 20-40% of capacity. The economy depends
  heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat. The continuation of civil
  strife has dimmed chances of foreign investment, and growth was a mere 0.3%
  in 1992. Living standards, already abysmally low, fell further in 1991-92.

*Namibia, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry to extract and
  process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost 25% of GDP. Namibia
  is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa and the world's
  fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond deposits are among the
  richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
  diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver,
  and tungsten. More than half the population depends on agriculture (largely
  subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood.

*Nauru, Economy

Overview:
  Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
  expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans
  one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World - $10,000 annually.
  Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be imported, including
  fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the
  replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems.
  Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
  cushion the transition.

*Nepal, Economy

Overview:
  Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
  Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over
  90% of the population and accounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial activity is
  limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute,
  sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has
  expanded recently and accounted for 85% of foreign exchange earnings in
  FY91. Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural
  resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production in the
  late 1980s grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population growth of
  2.6%. More than 40% of the population is undernourished partly because of
  poor distribution. The top 10% of the population receives 47% of total
  income, the bottom 20% less than 5% of the total. Since May 1991, the
  government has been encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by
  eliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order to
  simplify domestic and foreign investment. The government also has been
  cutting public expenditures by reducing subsides, privatizing state
  industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for foreign trade and
  investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of the small size of
  the economy, its technological backwardness, and its remoteness.

*Netherlands, Economy

Overview:
  This highly developed and affluent economy is based on private enterprise.
  The government makes its presence felt, however, through many regulations,
  permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting most aspects of economic
  activity. The trade and financial services sector contributes over 50% of
  GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the
  food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly
  mechanized agricultural sector employs only 5% of the labor force, but
  provides large surpluses for export and the domestic food-processing
  industry. Unemployment and a sizable budget deficit are currently the most
  serious economic problems. Many of the economic issues of the 1990s will
  reflect the course of European economic integration.

*New Zealand, Economy

Overview:
  Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian economy dependent
  on a guaranteed British market to an open free market economy that can
  compete on the global scene. The government has hoped that dynamic growth
  would boost real incomes, broaden and deepen the technological capabilities
  of the industrial sector, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the
  expansion of welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: inflation is
  down from double-digit levels, but growth was sluggish in 1988-91, and
  unemployment, always a highly sensitive issue, has exceeded 10% since May
  1991. In 1992, growth picked up to 3%, a sign that the new economic approach
  is beginning to pay off.

*Nicaragua, Economy

Overview:
  Government control of the economy historically has been extensive, although
  the CHAMORRO government has pledged to greatly reduce intervention. Four
  private banks have been licensed, and the government has liberalized foreign
  trade and abolished price controls on most goods. In early 1993, fewer than
  50% of the agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned. Sandinista
  economic policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis. The
  foundation of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural
  commodities, largely coffee and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7%
  in 1989 and 4% in 1990, and remained about even in 1991-92. The agricultural
  sector employs 44% of the work force and accounts for 15% of GDP and 80% of
  export earnings. Industry, which employs 13% of the work force and
  contributes about 25% to GDP, showed a drop of 7% in 1989, fell slightly in
  1990, and remained flat in 1991-92; output still is below pre-1979 levels.
  External debt is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis. In
  1992 the inflation rate was 8%, down sharply from the 766% of 1991.

*Niger, Economy

Overview:
  About 90% of the population is engaged in farming and stock raising,
  activities that generate almost half the national income. The economy also
  depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits. Uranium
  production grew rapidly in the mid-1970s, but tapered off in the early 1980s
  when world prices declined. France is a major customer, while Germany,
  Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases. The depressed demand for
  uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy, a severe
  trade imbalance, and a mounting external debt.

*Nigeria, Economy

Overview:
  Although Nigeria is Africa's leading oil-producing country, it remains poor
  with a $300 per capita GDP. In 1991-92 massive government spending, much of
  it to help ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule, ballooned the budget
  deficit and caused inflation and interest rates to rise. The lack of fiscal
  discipline forced the IMF to declare Nigeria not in compliance with an
  18-month standby facility started in January 1991. Lagos has set ambitious
  targets for expanding oil production capacity and is offering foreign
  companies more attractive investment incentives. Government efforts to
  reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil exports and to sustain noninflationary
  growth, however, have fallen short because of inadequate new investment
  funds and endemic corruption. Living standards remain below the level of the
  early 1980s oil boom.

*Niue, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand. Government
  expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by grants
  from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public employees. The
  agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some
  cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small
  factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The
  sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of
  revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of
  population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.

  helped the agricultural sector to become self-sufficient in the production
  of beef, poultry, and eggs.

*Northern Mariana Islands, Economy

Overview:
  The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the US.
  The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues
  have grown. An agreement for the years 1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to
  $228 million for capital development, government operations, and special
  programs. A rapidly growing major source of income is the tourist industry,
  which now employs about 50% of the work force. Japanese tourists
  predominate. The agricultural sector is made up of cattle ranches and small
  farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Industry is
  small scale, mostly handicrafts and light manufacturing.

*Norway, Economy

Overview:
  Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free market activity
  and government intervention. The government controls key areas, such as the
  vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state enterprises) and
  extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and areas with sparse
  resources. Norway also maintains an extensive welfare system that helps
  propel public sector expenditures to slightly more than 50% of the GDP and
  results in one of the highest average tax burdens in the world (54%). A
  small country with a high dependence on international trade, Norway is
  basically an exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an
  abundance of small- and medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major
  shipping nations. The country is richly endowed with natural resources -
  petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent
  on its oil sector to keep its economy afloat. Although one of the
  government's main priorities is to reduce this dependency, this situation is
  not likely to improve for years to come. The government also hopes to reduce
  unemployment and strengthen and diversify the economy through tax reform and
  a series of expansionary budgets. The budget deficit is expected to hit a
  record 8% of GDP because of welfare spending and bail-outs of the banking
  system. Unemployment continues at record levels of over 10% - including
  those in job programs - because of the weakness of the economy outside the
  oil sector. Overall economic growth is expected to be around 2% in 1993
  while inflation is likely to rise slightly to 4%. Oslo, a member of the
  European Free Trade Area, has applied for EC membership and continues to
  deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the European
  Economic Area (EEA) - which creates an EC/EFTA market with free movement of
  capital, goods, services, and labor - to take effect in late 1993 and its EC
  bid.

*Pacific Ocean, Geography

Location:

Area:
 total area:
  165.384 million km2
 comparative area:
  about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (followed by the
  Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about
  one-third of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the
  world
 note:
  includes Arafura Sea, Banda Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering
  Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Makassar Strait,
  Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China Sea,
  Tasman Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Coastline:
  135,663 km
International disputes:
  some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
  the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs during the summer
  months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a
  dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land
  mass back to the ocean
Terrain:
  surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a clockwise,
  warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in the southern
  Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the northern Pacific sea
  ice forms in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in winter; in the southern
  Pacific sea ice from Antarctica reaches its northernmost extent in October;
  the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific
  Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the
  world's deepest, the 10,924 meter Marianas Trench
Natural resources:
  oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
  deposits, fish
Environment:
  endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals,
  turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea;
  dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the
  southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in
  southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to
  October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
  Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and
  September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica;
  occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade
  winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, killing
  the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies; consequently,
  the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds
  to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source

*Pacific Ocean, Geography

Note:
  the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,
  and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the
  North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships subject to
  superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme
  south from May to October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June
  to December is a hazard to shipping; surrounded by a zone of violent
  volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring
  of Fire

*Pacific Ocean, Economy

Overview:
  The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
  particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides
  low-cost sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing
  grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the
  construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish
  catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish
  catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and
  gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of
  Australia, New Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering
  offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil
  since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.
Industries:
  fishing, oil and gas production

*Pakistan, Economy

Overview:
  Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the usual problems of
  rapidly increasing population, sizable government deficits, and heavy
  dependence on foreign aid. In addition, the economy must support a large
  military establishment. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in recent
  years has helped the country to cope with these problems. Almost all
  agriculture and small-scale industry is in private hands. In 1990, Pakistan
  embarked on a sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and
  domestic private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The SHARIF
  government denationalized several state-owned firms and attracted some
  foreign investment. Pakistan likely will have difficulty raising living
  standards because of its rapidly expanding population. At the current rate
  of growth, population would double in 25 years.

*Panama, Economy

Overview:

  economy thus continues to recover from the crisis that preceded the ouster

  program has been hampered by a lack of popular support and a passive
  administration. Public investment has been limited as the administration has
  kept the fiscal deficit below 3% of GDP. Unemployment and economic reform
  are the two major issues the government must face in 1993-94.

*Papua New Guinea, Economy

Overview:
  Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation
  has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of developing an
  infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the
  population. Mining of numerous deposits, including copper and gold, accounts
  for about 60% of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and
  development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy.
  Robust growth in 1991-92 was led by the mining sector; the opening of a
  large new gold mine helped the advance.

*Paraguay, Economy

Overview:
  Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GDP, employs
  about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay
  lacks substantial mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
  hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared
  with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual
  rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three of five
  years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose.
  Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the
  completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak
  international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy
  experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and
  stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery
  continued through 1990, on the strength of bumper crops in 1988-89. In a
  major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in
  March 1991 joined the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes
  Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an
  unorthodox approach, reduced external debt with both commercial and official
  creditors by purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt
  in the secondary market at a substantial discount. The government had paid
  100% of remaining official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France, and
  Spain. All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the long run,
  the government must press forward with general, market-oriented economic
  reforms.

 note:
  the 1979 Constitution and legislation enacted from 1987 to 1990 mandate the
  creation of regions (regiones, singular - region) intended to function
  eventually as autonomous economic and administrative entities; so far, 12
  regions have been constituted from 23 existing departments - Amazonas (from
  Loreto), Andres Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from
  Arequipa), Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from
  Cusco, Madre de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los
  Libertadores-Huari (from Ica, Ayacucho, Huancavelica), Mariategui (from
  Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from Lambayeque,
  Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin), Ucayali (from Ucayali);
  formation of another region has been delayed by the reluctance of the
  constitutional province of Callao to merge with the department of Lima;
  because of inadequate funding from the central government, the regions have
  yet to assume their responsibilities and at the moment coexist with the
  departmental structure

*Peru, Economy

Overview:
  The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented, with a large
  dose of government ownership remaining in mining, energy, and banking. In
  the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita
  output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World
  Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity
  program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in
  July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
  activity, but the slide halted late that year, and output rose 2.4% in 1991.
  After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated government
  price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the single-digit level and
  by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since mid-1987. Lima
  obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September
  1991, although it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external debt. By
  working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and
  arrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March 1993.
  In 1992, GDP fell by 2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual El Nino
  current resulted in a 30% drop in the fish catch. Meanwhile, revival of
  growth in GDP continued to be restricted by the large amount of public and
  private resources being devoted to strengthening internal security.

*Philippines, Economy

Overview:
  Domestic output in this primarily agricultural economy remained the same in
  1992 as in 1991. Drought and power supply problems hampered production,
  while inadequate revenues prevented government pump priming. Despite a flat
  GDP performance, GNP mustered a small 0.6% expansion, attributable to
  inflows of workers' remittances combined with smaller foreign interest
  payments. A marked increase in capital goods imports, particularly power
  generations equipment, telecommunications equipment, and electronic data
  processors, contributed to a 20.5% import growth in 1992. Exports rose 11%,
  led by earnings from the Philippines' two leading manufactures - electronics
  and garments.

*Poland, Economy

Overview:
  Poland is undergoing a difficult transition from a Soviet-style economy -
  with state ownership and control of productive assets - to a market economy.
  On January 1, 1990, the new Solidarity-led government implemented shock
  therapy by slashing subsidies, decontrolling prices, tightening the money
  supply, stabilizing the foreign exchange rate, lowering import barriers, and
  restraining state sector wages. As a result, consumer goods shortages and
  lines disappeared, and inflation fell from 640% in 1989 to 44% in 1992.
  Western governments, which hold two-thirds of Poland's $48 billion external
  debt, pledged in 1991 to forgive half of Poland's official debt by 1994. The
  private sector accounted for 29% of industrial production and nearly half of
  nonagricultural output in 1992. Production fell in state enterprises,
  however, and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing
  in 1989 to 13.6% in December 1992. Poland fell out of compliance with its
  IMF program by mid-1991, and talks with commercial creditors stalled. The
  increase in unemployment and the decline in living standards led to strikes
  in the coal, auto, copper, and railway sectors in 1992. Large state
  enterprises in the coal, steel, and defense sectors plan to halve employment
  over the next decade, and the government expects unemployment to reach 3
  million (16%) in 1993. A shortfall in tax revenues caused the budget deficit
  to reach 6% of GDP in 1992, but industrial production began a slow, uneven
  upturn. In 1993, the government will struggle to win legislative approval
  for faster privatization and to keep the budget deficit within IMF-approved
  limits.

*Portugal, Economy

Overview:
  Although Portugal has experienced strong growth since joining the EC in 1986
  - at least 4% each year through 1990 - it remains one of the poorest
  members. To prepare for the European single market, the government is
  restructuring and modernizing the economy and in 1989 embarked on a major
  privatization program. As of 1 January 1993, Lisbon has fully liberalized
  its capital markets and most trade markets. The global slowdown and tight
  monetary policies to counter inflation caused growth to slow in 1991 and
  1992. Growth probably will remain depressed in 1993, but should pick up
  again in 1994.

*Puerto Rico, Economy

Overview:
  Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean region.
  Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary sector of economic
  activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access to the US and by tax
  incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s.
  US minimum wage laws apply. Important industries include pharmaceuticals,
  electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar production
  has lost out to dairy production and other livestock products as the main
  source of income in the agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been
  an important source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of
  nearly 3 million tourists in 1989.

*Reunion, Economy

Overview:
  The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Sugarcane has been
  the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts for
  85% of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a tourist
  industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third
  of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is
  extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and
  Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
  population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups
  suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the
  African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991
  illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic
  well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from
  France.

  generates over half the GDP, suffers from an aging capital plant and
  persistent shortages of energy. The year 1991 witnessed a 17% drop in
  industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor
  unrest. In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with
  flooding, mismanagement, shortages of inputs, and disarray caused by the
  dismantling of cooperatives. A shortage of inputs and a severe drought in
  1991 contributed to a poor harvest, a problem compounded by corruption and
  an obsolete distribution system. The new government has instituted moderate
  land reforms, with more than one-half of cropland now in private hands, and
  it has liberalized private agricultural output. Private enterprises form an
  increasingly important portion of the economy largely in services,
  handicrafts, and small-scale industry. Little progress on large scale
  privatization has been made since a law providing for the privatization of
  large state firms was passed in August 1991. Most of the large state firms
  have been converted into joint-stock companies, but the selling of shares
  and assets to private owners has been delayed. While the government has
  halted the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard
  currency export markets, supplies remain scarce in some areas. The new
  government continues to impose price ceilings on key consumer items. In 1992
  the economy muddled along toward the new, more open system, yet output and
  living standards continued to fall.

*Russia, Economy

Overview:
  Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural resources and a diverse
  industrial base, continues to experience great difficulties in moving from
  its old centrally planned economy to a modern market economy. President
  YEL'TSIN's government made significant strides toward a market economy in
  1992 by freeing most prices, slashing defense spending, unifying foreign
  exchange rates, and launching an ambitious privatization program. At the
  same time, GDP fell 19%, according to official statistics, largely
  reflecting government efforts to restructure the economy, shortages of
  essential imports caused by the breakdown in former Bloc and interstate
  trade, and reduced demand following the freeing of prices in January. The
  actual decline, however, may have been less steep, because industrial and
  agricultural enterprises had strong incentives to understate output to avoid
  taxes, and official statistics may not have fully captured the output of the
  growing private sector. Despite the large drop in output, unemployment at
  yearend stood at an estimated 3%-4% of Russia's 74-million-person labor
  force; many people, however, are working shortened weeks or are on forced
  leave. Moscow's financial stabilization program got off to a good start at
  the beginning of 1992 but began to falter by midyear. Under pressure from
  industrialists and the Supreme Soviet, the government loosened fiscal
  policies in the second half. In addition, the Russian Central Bank relaxed
  its tight credit policy in July at the behest of new Acting Chairman, Viktor
  GERASHCHENKO. This loosening of financial policies led to a sharp increase
  in prices during the last quarter, and inflation reached about 25% per month
  by yearend. The situation of most consumers worsened in 1992. The January
  price liberalization and a blossoming of private vendors filled shelves
  across the country with previously scarce food items and consumer goods, but
  wages lagged behind inflation, making such goods unaffordable for many
  consumers. Falling real wages forced most Russians to spend a larger share
  of their income on food and to alter their eating habits. Indeed, many
  Russians reduced their consumption of higher priced meat, fish, milk,
  vegetables, and fruit, in favor of more bread and potatoes. As a result of
  higher spending on food, consumers reduced their consumption of nonfood
  goods and services. Despite a slow start and some rough going, the Russian
  government by the end of 1992 scored some successes in its campaign to break
  the state's stranglehold on property and improve the environment for private
  businesses. More peasant farms were created than expected; the number of
  consumers purchasing goods from private traders rose sharply; the portion of
  the population working in the private sector increased to nearly one-fifth;
  and the nine-month-long slump in the privatization of small businesses was
  ended in the fall. Although the output of weapons fell sharply in 1992, most
  defense enterprises continued to encounter numerous difficulties developing
  and marketing consumer products, establishing new supply links, and securing
  resources for retooling. Indeed, total civil production by the defense
  sector fell in 1992 because of shortages of inputs and lower consumer demand
  caused by higher prices. Ruptured ties with former trading partners, output
  declines, and sometimes erratic efforts to move to world prices and
  decentralize trade - foreign and interstate - took a heavy toll on Russia's
  commercial relations with other countries. For the second year in a row,
  foreign trade was down sharply, with exports falling by as much as 25% and
  imports by 21%. The drop in imports would have been much greater if foreign
  aid - worth an estimated $8 billion - had not allowed the continued inflow
  of essential products. Trade with the other former Soviet republics
  continued to decline, and support for the ruble as a common currency eroded
  in the face of Moscow's loose monetary policies and rapidly rising prices
  throughout the region. At the same time, Russia paid only a fraction of the
  $20 billion due on the former USSR's roughly $80 billion debt; debt
  rescheduling remained hung up because of a dispute between Russia and
  Ukraine over division of the former USSR's assets. Capital flight also
  remained a serious problem in 1992. Russia's economic difficulties did not

*Russia, Economy

  abate in the first quarter of 1993. Monthly inflation remained at
  double-digit levels and industrial production continued to slump. To reduce
  the threat of hyperinflation, the government proposed to restrict subsidies
  to enterprises; raise interest rates; set quarterly limits on credits, the
  budget deficit, and money supply growth; and impose temporary taxes and cut
  spending if budget targets are not met. But many legislators and Central
  Bank officials oppose various of these austerity measures and failed to
  approve them in the first part of 1993.

*Russia, Communications

Telecommunications:
  NMT-450 analog cellular telephone networks are opertional in Moscow and St.
  Petersburg; expanding access to international E-mail service via Sprint
  networks; the inadequacy of Russian telecommunications is a severe handicap
  to the economy, especially with respect to international connections; total
  installed telephones 24,400,000, of which in urban areas 20,900,000 and in
  rural areas 3,500,000; of these, total installed in homes 15,400,000; total
  pay phones for long distant calls 34,100; telephone density is about 164
  telephones per 1,000 persons; international traffic is handled by an
  inadequate system of satellites, land lines, microwave radio relay and
  outdated submarine cables; this traffic passes through the international
  gateway switch in Moscow which carries most of the international traffic for
  the other countries of the Confederation of Independent States; a new
  Russian Raduga satellite will soon link Moscow and St. Petersburg with Rome
  from whence calls will be relayed to destinations in Europe and overseas;
  satellite ground stations - INTELSAT, Intersputnik, Eutelsat (Moscow),
  INMARSAT, Orbita; broadcast stations - 1,050 AM/FM/SW (reach 98.6% of

*Rwanda, Economy

Overview:
  Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and tea make up
  80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and
  deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The industrial sector
  in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses
  mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy
  remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid. Weak international
  prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
  decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
  October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October 1990, has dampened
  prospects for economic improvement.
National product:
  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $2.35 billion (1992 est.)

  agricultural processing, small-scale beverage production, soap, furniture,
  shoes, plastic goods, textiles, cigarettes
Agriculture:
  accounts for almost 50% of GDP and about 90% of the labor force; cash crops
  - coffee, tea, pyrethrum (insecticide made from chrysanthemums); main food
  crops - bananas, beans, sorghum, potatoes; stock raising; self-sufficiency
  declining; country imports foodstuffs as farm production fails to keep up
  with a 3.8% annual growth in population

*Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Economy

Overview:
  The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by
  servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of Newfoundland. The
  economy has been declining, however, because the number of ships stopping at
  Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years. In March 1989, an
  agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pierre's
  trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadian-claimed waters for three years.
  The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish
  exports to a halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports
  come primarily from Canada and France.

*Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Economy

Overview:
  Agriculture, dominated by banana production, is the most important sector of
  the economy. The services sector, based mostly on a growing tourist
  industry, is also important. The economy continues to have a high
  unemployment rate of 35%-40% because of an overdependence on the
  weather-plagued banana crop as a major export earner. Government progress
  toward diversifying into new industries has been relatively unsuccessful.

*Sao Tome and Principe, Economy

Overview:
  The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
  independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa production has
  gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 1987
  output had fallen to less than 50% of its former levels. As a result, a
  shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance-of-payments
  problem. Production of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm
  kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of
  exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
  of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs.
  It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the years,
  Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which amounts to
  roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential exists for
  development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to
  expand facilities in recent years. The government also implemented a
  Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the economy and reschedule
  external debt service payments in cooperation with the International
  Development Association and Western lenders.

*Saudi Arabia, Economy

Overview:
  The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of
  GDP, and almost all export earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves
  of petroleum in the world, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and
  plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the government intends to
  encourage private economic activity and to foster the gradual process of
  turning Saudi Arabia into a modern industrial state that retains traditional
  Islamic values. Four million foreign workers play an important role in the
  Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and banking sectors.

  strife. Serbia and Montenegro faces major economic problems. First, like the
  other former Yugoslav republics, it depended on its sister republics for
  large amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and manufactures. Wide
  varieties in climate, mineral resources, and levels of technology among the
  republics accentuate this interdependence, as did the Communist practice of
  concentrating much industrial output in a small number of giant plants. The
  breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp drop in output as industrial
  plants lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction of physical assets in
  the fighting all have contributed to the economic difficulties of the
  republics. One singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and
  Montenegro is the continuation in office of a Communist government that is
  primarily interested in political and military mastery, not economic reform.
  A further complication is the imposition of economic sanctions by the UN.

*Seychelles, Economy

Overview:
  In this small, open, tropical island economy, the tourist industry employs
  about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard currency
  earnings. In recent years the government has encouraged foreign investment
  in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the
  government has moved to reduce the high dependence on tourism by promoting
  the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing.

*Sierra Leone, Economy

Overview:
  The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed. Subsistence
  agriculture dominates the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and
  employing about two-thirds of the working population. Manufacturing, which
  accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw
  materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining
  provides an important source of hard currency. The economy suffers from high
  unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing
  dependency on foreign assistance. The government in 1990 was attempting to
  get the budget deficit under control and, in general, to bring economic
  policy in line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank. Since
  March 1991, however, military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and
  eastern Sierra Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined
  efforts to institute economic reforms.

*Singapore, Economy

Overview:
  Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong service and
  manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links derived from
  its entrepot history. The economy appears to have pulled off a soft landing
  from the 9% growth rate of the late 1980s, registering higher than expected
  growth in 1992 while stemming inflation. Economic activity slowed early in
  1992, primarily as a result of slackened demand in Singapore's export
  markets. But after bottoming out in the second quarter, the economy picked
  up in line with a gradual recovery in the United States. The year's best
  performers were the construction and financial services industries and
  manufacturers of computer-related components. Rising labor costs continue to
  be a threat to Singapore's competitiveness, but there are indications that
  productivity is catching up. Government surpluses and the rate of gross
  national savings remain high. In technology, per capita output, and labor
  discipline, Singapore is well on its way toward its goal of becoming a
  developed country.

*Slovakia, Economy

Overview:
  The dissolution of Czechoslovakia into two independent states - the Czech
  Republic and Slovakia - on 1 January 1993 has complicated the task of moving
  toward a more open and decentralized economy. The old Czechoslovakia, even
  though highly industrialized by East European standards, suffered from an
  aging capital plant, lagging technology, and a deficiency in energy and many
  raw materials. In January 1991, approximately one year after the end of
  communist control of Eastern Europe, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic
  launched a sweeping program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and
  controlled economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in
  privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and the
  setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost in
  inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a whole
  inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992 in Slovakia,
  inflation slowed to an estimated 8.7% and the estimated fall in GDP was a
  more moderate 7%. In 1993 the government anticipates up to a 7% drop in GDP,
  with the disruptions from the separation from the Czech lands probably
  accounting for half the decline; inflation, according to government
  projections, may rise to 15-20% and unemployment may reach 12-15%. The
  Slovak government is moving ahead less enthusiastically than the Czech
  government in the further dismantling of the old centrally controlled
  economic system. Although the governments of Slovakia and the Czech Republic
  had envisaged retaining the koruna as a common currency at least in the
  short run, the two countries ended the currency union in February 1993.

*Slovenia, Economy

Overview:
  Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the former Yugoslav republics,
  with a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav average, indeed not
  far below the levels in neighboring Austria and Italy. Because of its strong
  ties to Western Europe and the small scale of damage during its fight for
  independence from Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the
  former Yugoslav republics for economic recovery over the next few years. The
  dissolution of Yugoslavia, however, has led to severe short-term
  dislocations in production, employment, and trade ties. For example, overall
  industrial production fell 10% in 1991; particularly hard hit were the iron
  and steel, machine-building, chemical, and textile industries. Meanwhile,
  the continued fighting in other former Yugoslavian republics has led to
  further destruction of long-established trade channels and to an influx of
  tens of thousands of Croatian and Bosnian refugees. The key program for
  breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms was established in late
  1992. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenia's
  comparatively well-educated work force, its developed infrastructure, and
  its Western business attitudes, but instability in Croatia is a deterrent.
  Slovenia in absolute terms is a small economy, and a little Western
  investment would go a long way.

*Somalia, Economy

Overview:
  One of the world's poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has few
  resources. Moreover, much of the economy has been devastated by the civil
  war. Agriculture is the most important sector, with livestock accounting for
  about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and seminomads who
  are dependent upon livestock for their livelihoods make up more than half of
  the population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and employs about
  20% of the work force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and
  corn are grown for the domestic market. The small industrial sector is based
  on the processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10% of
  GDP. Greatly increased political turmoil in 1991-92 has resulted in a
  substantial drop in output, with widespread famine.

*South Africa, Economy

Overview:
  Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population enjoy incomes,
  material comforts, and health and educational standards equal to those of
  Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from
  the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment and lack of
  job skills. The main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral
  resources, which provide two-thirds of exports. Economic developments in the
  1990s will be driven partly by the changing relations among the various
  ethnic groups. The shrinking economy in recent years has absorbed less than
  10% of the more than 300,000 workers entering the labor force annually.
  Local economists estimate that the economy must grow between 5% and 6% in
  real terms annually to absorb all of the new entrants.

*Spain, Economy

Overview:
  Spain has done well since joining the EC in 1986. Foreign and domestic
  investments have spurred GDP growth at an annual average of more than 4% in
  1986-91. As of 1 January 1993, Spain has wholly liberalized its trade and
  capital markets to EC standards, including integrating agriculture two years
  ahead of schedule. Beginning in 1989, Madrid implemented a tight monetary
  policy to fight 7% inflation. As a result of this action and the worldwide
  decline in economic growth, Spain's growth rate declined to 1% in 1992.
  Spain faces a likely recession in first half 1993. The government expects a
  recovery in the second half, but this depends on stepped-up growth in
  Germany and France. The slowdown in growth - along with displacements caused
  by structural adjustments in preparation for the EC single market - has
  pushed an already high unemployment rate up to 19%. However, many people
  listed as unemployed work in the underground economy. If the government can
  stick to its tough economic policies and push further structural reforms,
  the economy will emerge stronger at the end of the 1990s.

*Sudan, Economy

Overview:
  Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse
  weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances from abroad, and
  counterproductive economic policies. The economy is dominated by
  governmental entities that account for more than 70% of new investment. The
  private sector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading, with
  most private industrial investment predating 1980. The economy's base is
  agriculture, which employs 80% of the work force. Industry mainly processes
  agricultural items. Sluggish economic performance over the past decade,
  attributable largely to declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per
  capita income and consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages
  continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary Fund took
  the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its nonpayment
  of arrearages to the Fund. Despite subsequent government efforts to
  implement reforms urged by the IMF and the World Bank, the economy remained
  stagnant in FY91 as entrepreneurs lack the incentive to take economic risks.
  Growth in 1992 was featured by the recovery of agricultural production in
  northern Sudan after two years of drought.

*Suriname, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts for 15% of
  GDP and about 70% of export earnings. The economy has been in trouble since
  the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world bauxite prices
  which started in the late 1970s and continued until late 1986 was followed
  by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in the interior that crippled the
  important bauxite sector. Although the insurgency has since ebbed and the
  bauxite sector recovered, a military coup in December 1990 reflected
  continued political instability and deterred investment and economic reform.
  High inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market activity, and
  hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.

*Svalbard, Economy

Overview:
  Coal mining is the major economic activity on Svalbard. By treaty (9
  February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights to
  exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK,
  Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies
  still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are
  essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs
  nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local
  services, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some
  trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.

*Swaziland, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which occupies most of the
  labor force and contributes nearly 25% to GDP. Manufacturing, which includes
  a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts for another quarter of GDP.
  Mining has declined in importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore
  deposits were depleted in 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for
  asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of
  hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with
  Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it
  receives 75% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.

*Sweden, Economy

Overview:
  Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I through
  World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
  mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. It has
  a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external
  communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore
  constitute the resource base of an economy that is heavily oriented toward
  foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for about 90% of industrial
  output, of which the engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and
  exports. In the last few years, however, this extraordinarily favorable
  picture has been clouded by inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual
  loss of competitiveness in international markets. Although Prime Minister
  BILDT'S center-right minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead with
  free-market-oriented reforms, a skyrocketing budget deficit - almost 13% of
  GDP in FY94 projections - and record unemployment have forestalled many of
  the plans. Unemployment in 1993 is forecast at around 7% with another 5% in
  job training. Continued heavy foreign exchange speculation forced the
  government to cooperate in late 1992 with the opposition Social Democrats on
  two crisis packages - one a severe austerity pact and the other a program to
  spur industrial competitiveness - which basically set economic policy
  through 1997. In November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's ECU, and
  the krona has since depreciated around 2.5% against the dollar. The
  government hopes the boost in export competitiveness from the depreciation
  will help lift Sweden out of its 3-year recession. To curb the budget
  deficit and bolster confidence in the economy, BILDT continues to propose
  cuts in welfare benefits, subsidies, defense, and foreign aid. Sweden
  continues to harmonize its economic policies with those of the EC in
  preparation for concluding its EC membership bid by 1995.

*Switzerland, Economy

Overview:
  Switzerland's economy - one of the most prosperous and stable in the world -
  is nonetheless undergoing a painful adjustment after both the inflationary
  boom of the late-1980s and the electorate's rejection late last year of
  membership in the European Economic Area. Stubborn inflation and a soft
  economy have afflicted Switzerland. Despite slow growth in 1991-92, the
  Swiss central bank had been unable to ease monetary policy in the past three
  years because of the threat to the Swiss franc posed by high German interest
  rates. As a result, unemployment is forecast to rise from 3% in 1992 to more
  than 4% in 1993, with inflation moving down from 4% to 3%. The voters'
  rejection in December 1992 of a referendum on membership in the EEA which
  was supported by most political, business, and financial leaders has raised
  doubts that the country can maintain its preeminent prosperity and
  leadership in commercial banking in the 21st century. Despite these
  problems, Swiss per capita output, general living standards, education and
  science, health care, and diet remain unsurpassed in Europe. The country has
  few natural resources except for the scenic natural beauty that has made it
  a world leader in tourism. Management-labor relations remain generally
  harmonious.

*Syria, Economy

Overview:
  Syria's state-dominated Ba'thist economy has benefited from the Gulf war,
  increased oil production, good weather, and economic deregulation. Economic
  growth averaged nearly 12% annually in 1990-91, buoyed by increased oil
  production and improved agricultural performance. The Gulf war of early 1991
  provided Syria an aid windfall of nearly $5 billion dollars from Arab,
  European, and Japanese donors. These inflows more than offset Damascus's
  war-related costs and will help Syria cover some of its debt arrears,
  restore suspended credit lines, and initiate selected military and civilian
  purchases. In 1992 the government spurred economic development by loosening
  controls on domestic and foreign investment while maintaining strict
  political controls. For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with
  a large number of poorly performing public sector firms and industrial and
  agricultural productivity is poor. A major long-term concern is the
  additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when its vast dam and
  irrigation projects are completed by mid-decade.

*Taiwan, Economy

Overview:
  Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable government
  guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial government ownership of
  some large banks and industrial firms. Real growth in GNP has averaged about
  9% a year during the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster
  and has provided the impetus for industrialization. Agriculture contributes
  about 4% to GNP, down from 35% in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13
  among major trading countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are
  steadily being replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive
  industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand,
  Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The tightening of labor markets
  has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.

  people were made homeless by the strife. In late 1992, one-third of industry
  was shut down and the cotton crop was only one-half of that of 1991.

*Tanzania, Economy

Overview:
  Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy is
  heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 58% of GDP,
  provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry
  accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural
  products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced
  in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
  financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the
  International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to
  rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in
  1991-92 featured a pickup in industrial production and a substantial
  increase in output of minerals led by gold.

*Thailand, Economy

Overview:
  Thailand's economy recovered rapidly from the political unrest in May 1992
  to post an impressive 7% growth rate for the year. Thailand, one of the more
  advanced developing countries in Asia, depends on exports of manufactures
  and the development of the service sector to fuel the country's rapid
  growth. The trade and current account deficits fell in 1992; much of
  Thailand's recent imports have been for capital equipment suggesting that
  the export sector is poised for further growth. With foreign investment
  slowing, Bangkok is working to increase the generation of capital
  domestically. Prime Minister CHUAN's government - Thailand's fifth
  government in less than two years - is pledged to continue Bangkok's
  probusiness policies, and the return of a democratically elected government
  has improved business confidence. Nevertheless, CHUAN must overcome
  divisions within his ruling coalition to complete much needed infrastructure
  development programs if Thailand is to remain an attractive place for
  business investment. Over the longer-term, Bangkok must produce more college
  graduates with technical training and upgrade workers' skills to continue
  its rapid economic development.

*Togo, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which accounts
  for about 33% of GDP and provides employment for 78% of the labor force.
  Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and cotton, which together
  account for about 30% of total export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in
  basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector
  phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, with phosphate
  exports accounting for about 40% of total foreign exchange earnings. Togo
  serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government, over the
  past decade, with IMF and World Bank support, has been implementing a number
  of economic reform measures to encourage foreign investment and bring
  revenues in line with expenditures. Political unrest, including private and
  public sector strikes throughout 1991 and 1992, has jeopardized the reform
  program and has disrupted vital economic activity.

*Tonga, Economy

Overview:
  The economy's base is agriculture, which employs about 70% of the labor
  force and contributes 40% to GDP. Coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans are
  the main crops and make up two-thirds of exports. The country must import a
  high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The manufacturing
  sector accounts for only 11% of GDP. Tourism is the primary source of hard
  currency earnings, but the island remains dependent on sizable external aid
  and remittances to offset its trade deficit.

*Trinidad and Tobago, Economy

Overview:
  Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy has begun to emerge from a
  lengthy depression in the last few years. The economy fell sharply through
  most of the 1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices. This sector
  accounts for 80% of export earnings and almost 20% of GDP. The government,
  in response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures
  that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22% in 1988. The economy showed
  signs of recovery in 1990 and 1991, however, helped along by rising oil
  prices. Agriculture employs only about 11% of the labor force and produces
  about 3% of GDP. Since this sector is small, it has been unable to absorb
  the large numbers of the unemployed. The government currently seeks to
  diversify its export base.

*Tunisia, Economy

Overview:
  The economy depends primarily on petroleum, phosphates, tourism, and exports
  of light manufactures. Following two years of drought-induced economic
  decline, the economy came back strongly in 1990-92 as a result of good
  harvests, continued export growth, and higher domestic investment. High
  unemployment has eroded popular support for the government, however, and
  forced Tunis to slow the pace of economic reform. Nonetheless, the
  government appears committed to implementing its IMF-supported structural
  adjustment program and to servicing its foreign debt.

*Turkey, Economy

Overview:
  After an impressive economic performance through most of the 1980s, Turkey
  has experienced erratic rates of economic growth since 1988 - ranging from a
  high of 9.2% in 1990 to a low of 0.9% in 1991. Strong consumer demand and
  increased public investment led the way to a strong 5.9% growth in 1992.
  Chronic high inflation is Turkey's most serious economic problem, leading to
  high interest rates and the rapid depreciation of the Turkish lira. The huge
  public sector deficit - about 12% of GDP - and the Treasury's heavy reliance
  on Central Bank financing of the deficit are the major causes of Turkish
  inflation. Meanwhile, wage increases in both the public and private sector
  have outpaced productivity gains, limited the government's ability to reduce
  current expenditures, and hindered the return to profitability of many
  private companies. Agriculture remains an important economic sector,
  employing about half of the work force, contributing 18% to GDP, and
  accounting for about 20% of exports. The government has launched a
  multibillion-dollar development program in the southeastern region, which
  includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to
  generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The Turkish
  economy will probably continue to grow faster than the West European average
  in 1993, but the shaky coalition government of Prime Minister DEMIREL -
  which has seen its parliamentary majority shrink from 36 to 11 seats during
  its first year in power - is unlikely to risk further erosion of its support
  by implementing the belt-tightening measures necessary to substantially
  reduce inflation.

*Turkmenistan, Economy

Overview:
  Like the other 15 former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan faces enormous
  problems of economic adjustment - to move away from Moscow-based central
  planning toward a system of decisionmaking by private entrepreneurs, local
  government authorities, and, hopefully, foreign investors. This process
  requires wholesale changes in supply sources, markets, property rights, and
  monetary arrangements. Industry - with 10% of the labor force - is heavily
  weighted toward the energy sector, which produced 11% of the ex-USSR's gas
  and 1% of its oil. Turkmenistan ranked second among the former Soviet
  republics in cotton production, mainly in the irrigated western region,
  where the huge Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya. The general decline in
  national product accelerated in 1992, principally because of inability to
  obtain spare parts and disputes with customers over the price of natural
  gas.

*Tuvalu, Economy

Overview:
  Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor soil.
  The country has no known mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence
  farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. The islands are too
  small and too remote for development of a tourist industry. Government
  revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
  remittances. Substantial income is received annually from an international
  trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, New Zealand, and the UK and
  supported also by Japan and South Korea.

*Uganda, Economy

Overview:
  Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular
  rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. The economy has
  been devastated by widespread political instability, mismanagement, and
  civil war since independence in 1962, keeping Uganda poor with a per capita
  income of about $300. (GDP remains below the levels of the early 1970s, as
  does industrial production.) Agriculture is the most important sector of the
  economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export
  crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government
  has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency
  reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices of
  petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes
  are especially aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over 300%
  in 1987, and boosting production and export earnings. In 1990-92, the
  economy has turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in
  the rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and
  exports, and gradually improving domestic security.

*Ukraine, Economy

Overview:
  After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the most important
  economic component of the former Soviet Union producing more than three
  times the output of the next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil
  generated more than one fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms
  provided substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain and vegetables to other
  republics. Likewise, its well-developed and diversified heavy industry
  supplied equipment and raw materials to industrial and mining sites in other
  regions of the former USSR. In 1992 the Ukrainian government liberalized
  most prices and erected a legal framework for privatizing state enterprises
  while retaining many central economic controls and continuing subsidies to
  state production enterprises. In November 1992 the new Prime Minister KUCHMA
  launched a new economic reform program promising more freedom to the
  agricultural sector, faster privatization of small and medium enterprises,
  and stricter control over state subsidies. Even so, the magnitude of the
  problems and the slow pace in building new market-oriented institutions
  preclude a near-term recovery of output to the 1990 level.

*United Kingdom, Economy

Overview:
  The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial centers, and
  its economy ranks among the four largest in Europe. The economy is
  essentially capitalistic; over the past thirteen years the ruling Tories
  have greatly reduced public ownership and contained the growth of social
  welfare programs. Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient
  by European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the
  labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves, and
  primary energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares
  of any industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and
  business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while
  industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only 25% of the
  work force and generating 21% of GDP. The economy is emerging out of its
  3-year recession with only weak recovery expected in 1993. Unemployment is
  hovering around 10% of the labor force. The government in 1992 adopted a
  pro-growth strategy, cutting interest rates sharply and removing the pound
  from the European exchange rate mechanism. Excess industrial capacity
  probably will moderate inflation which for the first time in a decade is
  below the EC average. The major economic policy question for Britain in the
  1990s is the terms on which it participates in the financial and economic
  integration of Europe.

*United States, Economy

Overview:
  The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced economy
  in the world, with a per capita GDP of $23,400, the largest among major
  industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with most decisions made
  by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of
  goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace. In 1989 the
  economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the
  longest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in wage and
  consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of
  the labor force. In 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a
  combination of factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates,
  Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and
  a general decline in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output fell
  by 1%, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature. Growth
  picked up to 2.1% in 1992. Unemployment, however, remained at nine million,
  the increase in GDP being mainly attributable to gains in output per worker.
  Ongoing problems for the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic
  infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and trade
  deficits.

*Uruguay, Economy

Overview:
  Uruguay is a small economy with favorable climate, good soils, and solid
  hydropower potential. Economic development has been held back by excessive
  government regulation of economic detail and 50% to 130% inflation. After
  several years of sluggish growth, real GDP jumped by about 8% in 1992. The
  rise is attributable mainly to an increase in Argentine demand for Uruguayan
  exports, particularly agricultural products and electricity. In a major step
  toward greater regional economic cooperation, Uruguay in 1991 had joined
  Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market
  (Mercosur). A referendum in December 1992 overturned key portions of
  landmark privatization legislation, dealing a serious blow to President
  LACALLE's broad economic reform plan.

*Uzbekistan, Economy

Overview:
  Although Uzbekistan accounted for only 3.4% of total Soviet output, it
  produced two-thirds of the USSR's cotton and ranks as the fourth largest
  global producer. Moscow's push for ever-increasing amounts of cotton had
  included massive irrigation projects which caused extensive environmental
  damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic. Furthermore, the lavish
  use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive pollution and widespread
  health problems. Recently the republic has sought to encourage food
  production at the expense of cotton. The small industrial sector specializes
  in such items as agricultural machinery, mineral fertilizers, vegetable oil,
  and bridge cranes. Uzbekistan also has some important natural resources
  including gold (about 30% of former Soviet production), uranium, and natural
  gas. The Uzbek Government has encouraged some land reform but has shied away
  from other aspects of economic reform. Output and living standards continued
  to fall in 1992 largely because of the cumulative impact of disruptions in
  supply that have followed the dismemberment of the USSR.

  market exchange rate, and market-linked interest rates threw the economy
  into confusion, causing an 8% decline in GDP in 1989. However, the economy

*Vietnam, Economy

Overview:
  Vietnam has made significant progress in recent years moving away from the
  planned economic model and toward a more effective market-based economic
  system. Most prices are now fully decontrolled and the Vietnamese currency
  has been effectively devalued and floated at world market rates. In
  addition, the scope for private sector activity has been expanded, primarily
  through decollectivization of the agricultural sector and introduction of
  laws giving legal recognition to private business. Despite such positive
  indicators, the country's economic turnaround remains tenuous. Nearly
  three-quarters of export earnings are generated by only two commodities,
  rice and crude oil. Meanwhile, industrial production stagnates, burdened by
  uncompetitive state-owned enterprises the government is unwilling or unable
  to privatize. Unemployment looms as the most serious problem with over 25%
  of the workforce without jobs and population growth swelling the ranks of
  the unemployed yearly.

*Wallis and Futuna, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is limited to traditional subsistence agriculture, with about
  80% of the labor force earning its livelihood from agriculture (coconuts and
  vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs), and fishing. About 4% of the
  population is employed in government. Revenues come from French Government
  subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import
  taxes, and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and
  Futuna imports food, fuel, clothing, machinery, and transport equipment, but
  its exports are negligible, consisting of copra and handicrafts.

*West Bank, Header

  The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
  control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
  Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by
  President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the
  West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
  peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
  concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
  resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
  it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
  has yet to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank
  describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian
  administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, with respect to
  negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, it is US policy that a
  distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank
  because of the city's special status and circumstances. Therefore, a
  negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in
  character from that of the rest of the West Bank.

*West Bank, Economy

Overview:
  Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military
  administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising (intifadah).
  Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have
  been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli
  policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not
  productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli
  industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers
  employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states, but such transfers from the Gulf
  dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake
  of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West
  Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have plunged because of
  the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to
  curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living
  standards. The area's economic outlook remains bleak.

*World, Economy

Overview:
  Real global output--gross world product (GWP)--rose one-half of 1% in 1992,
  with results varying widely among regions and countries. Average growth of
  1.5% in the GDP of industrialized countries (62% of GWP in 1992) and average
  growth of 5% in the GDP of less developed countries (30% of GWP) were offset
  by a further 15-20% drop in the GDP of the former Soviet-East European area
  (now only 8% of GWP). The United States accounted for 23% of GWP in 1992;
  the 12-member European Community, which established a single internal market
  on 1 January 1993, accounted for another 23%, and Japan accounted for 10%.
  These are the three "economic superpowers" presumably destined to compete
  for mastery in international markets on into the 21st century. In general,
  growth in the industrialized countries was sluggish in 1992, with
  unemployment typically at 7-11%. As for the less developed countries, China,
  India, and the Four Dragons--South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
  Singapore--posted good records; however, many other countries, especially in
  Africa, suffered bitterly from drought, rapid population growth, and civil
  strife. The continued plunge in production in practically all the former
  Warsaw Pact economies strained the political and social fabric of these
  newly independent nations, in particular in Russia. The addition of nearly
  100 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is exacerbating
  the problems of pollution, desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and
  famine. Because of their own internal problems, the industrialized countries
  have inadequate resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the
  world, which, at least from the economic point of view, are becoming further
  marginalized. (For the specific economic problems of each country, see the
  individual country entries in this volume.)
National product:

  (1992 est.)

Electricity:
  2,864,000,000 kW capacity; 11,450,000 million kWh produced, 2,150 kWh per
  capita (1990)
Industries:
  industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology, especially in
  computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical
  equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a small
  portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
  technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial
  nations and the less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid
  development of new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating
  already grim environmental problems
Agriculture:
  the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last
  20 years; the annual production of cereals, for instance, has risen by 50%,
  from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion metric tons;
  production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
  increases in planted areas; while global production is sufficient for
  aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's population remains
  malnourished, primarily because local production cannot adequately provide
  for large and rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for
  food imports; conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
  recent years has intensified the consequences of overpopulation

*Yemen, Economy

Overview:
  Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united Yemen,
  the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, is the
  economic and commercial capital. Future economic development depends heavily
  on Western-assisted development of promising oil resources. Former South
  Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in
  Soviet economic support. The low level of domestic industry and agriculture
  have made northern Yemen dependent on imports for virtually all of its
  essential needs. Large trade deficits have been compensated for by
  remittances from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign aid. Once
  self-sufficient in food production, northern Yemen has become a major
  importer. Land once used for export crops - cotton, fruit, and vegetables -
  has been turned over to growing qat, a mildly narcotic shrub chewed by
  Yemenis which has no significant export market. Oil export revenues started
  flowing in late 1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about $800 million.
  Economic growth in former South Yemen has been constrained by a lack of
  incentives, partly stemming from centralized control over production
  decisions, investment allocation, and import choices.

*Zaire, Economy

Overview:
  In 1992, Zaire's formal economy continued to disintegrate. While meaningful
  economic figures are difficult to come by, Zaire's hyperinflation, the
  largest government deficit ever, and plunging mineral production have made
  the country one of the world's poorest. Most formal transactions are
  conducted in hard currency as indigenous banknotes have lost almost all
  value, and a barter economy now flourishes in all but the largest cities.
  Most individuals and families hang on grimly through subsistence farming and
  petty trade. The government has not been able to meet its financial
  obligations to the International Momentary Fund or put in place the
  financial measures advocated by the IMF. Although short-term prospects for
  improvement are dim, improved political stability would boost Zaire's
  long-term potential to effectively exploit its vast wealth of mineral and
  agricultural resources.

*Zambia, Economy

Overview:
  The economy has been in decline for more than a decade with falling imports
  and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties stem from a chronically
  depressed level of copper production and ineffective economic policies. In
  1991 real GDP fell by 2% and in 1992 by 3% more. An annual population growth
  of more than 3% has brought a decline in per capita GDP of 50% over the past
  decade. A high inflation rate has also added to Zambia's economic woes in
  recent years, as well as severe drought in the crop year 1991/92.

*Zimbabwe, Economy

Overview:
  Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and supplies almost 40%
  of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture and mining,
  produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP. Mining accounts for
  only 5% of both GDP and employment, but supplies of minerals and metals
  account for about 40% of exports. Wide fluctuations in agricultural
  production over the past six years have resulted in an uneven growth rate,
  one that on average has matched the 3% annual increase in population. Helped
  by an IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program, output rose 3.5% in
  1991. A severe drought in 1991/92 caused the economy to contract by about
  10% in 1992.

The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has
dissolved, and ceases to exist. None of the successor states of the
former Yugoslavia, including Serbia and Montenegro, have been permitted to
participate solely on the basis of the membership of the former Yugoslavia
in the United Nations General Assembly and Economic and Social Council and
their subsidiary bodies and in various United Nations Specialized Agencies.
The United Nations, however, permits the seat and nameplate of the SFRY to
remain, permits the SFRY mission to continue to function, and continues to
fly the flag of the former Yugoslavia. For a variety of reasons, a number
of other organizations have not yet taken action with regard to the membership
of the former Yugoslavia. The The World Factbook therefore continues to list
Yugoslavia under international organizations where the SFRY seat remains or
where no action has yet been taken.

Metric Interrelationships

Conversions from a multiple or submultiple to the basic units of meters,
liters, or grams can be done using the table.  For example, to convert from
kilometers to meters, multiply by 1,000 (9.26 kilometers equals 9,260 meters)
or to convert from meters to kilometers, multiply by 0.001 (9,260 meters equals
9.26 kilometers).
