**Etexts Readable By Both Humans and By Computers, Since 1971**

*These Etexts Prepared By Hundreds of Volunteers and Donations*

Information on contacting Project Gutenberg to get Etexts, and
further information is included below.  We need your donations.
Since the author also requests remuneration, we would ask these
donations to Project Gutenberg be reduced to half of what would
normally be sent, the other half to the author.

The ***Copyrighted*** Project Gutenberg Etext of:

THE ONLINE WORLD

The Online World book's text on paper, disk and in any other 
electronic form is (C) copyrighted 1993 by Odd de Presno. All

****This file should be named online11.txt or online11.zip****


Project Gutenberg has received the permission of the author to
create a new edition of "The Online World" which would include
the removal of most end-of-line hyphenation, extra efforts for
margin justification, etc; if you are interested in joining in
this effort, please let us know [Project Gutenberg established
a particular method of presenting Etexts onscreen that make an
Etext easier to read, search, etc.].


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

We need your donations more than ever!

All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/IBC", and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law ("IBC" is Illinois
Benedictine College).  (Subscriptions to our paper newsletter go

PREFACE
=======
This is the ASCII online distribution of the Online World. It deals 
with the practical aspects of using the rapidly growing global online
information resource. 
    The book is distributed in a form that is designed to be easily 
accessible with the maximum range of computers, printer types, and 
search programs. Also, it has been designed to be compatible with 
electronic reading devices for the blind. Therefore, many frills 
(such as fancy formatting, extraneous characters or tags) have been 
omitted. 
    The main subject of the book is what you can get out of the 
online resource. 
    Expect an outline, not a comprehensive list or directory of all 
available offerings. This book explores selected applications 
across network and service boundaries, to show how these needs may 
be satisfied. 
    In the process, it gives access information for a large number 
of specific online offerings. 
    The applications range from entertainment and the bizarre to 
databases and special services for professionals and organizations. 
    You are not expected to live in the United States or in Norway. 
Emphasis is on major international offerings available through 
services and networks like the Internet, BITNET, CompuServe, Echo, 
FidoNet, Usenet, Dialcom, Dow Jones/News Retrieval, MCI, NewsNet 
and UUCP. These services can be accessed from almost anywhere. 
    Talking about the Internet, we do not expect that it will be 
easy for you to get full access. We assume that most people can get 
access to this network by electronic mail only. 
    I wrote The Online World for parents and youth, teachers, 
students, business people, social workers, psychologists, young, 
old, for anybody interested in knowing a bit more about our 
current "Global Village." 
    You can read it like a novel, to get an idea of what is going 
on. It can be used as a practical guide book to online data bases 
and news sources, or as a book of reference. 
    You need not be a computer expert or an experienced "onliner" 
to find it useful. 
    While not being a textbook on data communications, it contains 
much information to help novices get started. For an introduction 
to telecommunications, check out appendix 2 and 3 before continuing 
with Chapter 1. 
    Before you start, one word of warning. New online offerings are 
born each day, while others are being closed down. Chances are that 
most services in this book will still be around when you read it, 
but I will need to update the text regularly. Therefore, all 
feedback is welcomed with thanks. 
    Please do also tell me what you like, what you don't, and what 
you feel I may have missed -- or have gotten hopelessly wrong. Send 
by electronic mail to me at opresno@extern.uio.no . 

This book is not free
---------------------
The Online World book is NOT public domain. It is copyrighted work 
and may be distributed only pursuant to this license. 
    You are granted a limited read and use license of the book to 
see if it is for you. Any unregistered use other than to determine 
if the book meets your needs is a violation of this license and is 
forbidden. 
    If you like the book, please become a registered reader. Your 
contribution will support further research and development of the 
text. 
    The important benefit of registering is that you will receive 
the latest version of the book on diskette (MS-DOS only). This will 
allow you to have current information on your hard disk  that you 
can search whenever you want to. 
     The online world is dynamic. Services and offerings come and 
go. So read appendix 8 to find out how to stay updated. 

The registered shareware version of The Online World including 
shipping and handling is 

              NOK 105.00           for payment by credit card 
                                   (around US$ 15.00)
              US$ 20.00            for all other types of payment
                                   (check or SWIFT bank transfer) 

As an alternative, you can also register for six updates of the 
book during one year. The updates will be mailed you on computer 
diskette: 

              US$60.00             for all types of payment

The special rates for organizations to make the text available to 
employees etc. over a network are explained in appendix 8. 
    Please note: As I do not receive any renumeration from vendors 
of shareware disks, you must register your copy to have a legal 
license for use of the book beyond an evaluation period. 

Please give to others
---------------------

Online World book so long as:

    (2)  Distribution is without  ANY modification to the contents

    (3)  No publication of the book or individual articles from the

of this license.  Any other use, including bundling of any of the 
book's chapters or appendixes for your own distribution, is

program. My private favorites are: 

    LIST       -  Shareware MS-DOS file viewing program,

    LOOKFOR    -  Shareware boolean text search program.

Chapter 1: Going online will make me rich, right?
=================================================

The number of services is enormous. It takes time to find the 
truly interesting stuff.
- Knowledge is power.
- A large personal network gives you a punch.
- The value of information, and of having a good time.

Knowledge is Power
------------------
My wife has a rare and dangerous kidney disease. One day her doctor
joined us on an online research session to look for experiences and 
advice in other countries. 
    We sat down in my office in Norway. I turned on my personal 
computer and started a communications program. 
    After some keypresses, we could hear the attached modem dial 
the number of CompuServe, a North American information utility. (A 
modem is a piece of equipment that converts computer signals to and 
from sound codes, so that data can be sent by phone.) 
    It took just a few seconds to make the connection. Soon, a 
greeting scrolled over our screen, followed by a menu of available 
choices. 

    For an introduction to practical telecommunications, check out 
    appendix 2 and 3. Appendix 1 lists major services mentioned in 
    this book. 

We selected "Health" and the "Data Base for Rare diseases." This 
gave the address of an American foundation for "cysts in kidneys," 
which is the name of her disease. My wife made contact, and has 
since received regular reports of research results and experiences 
gained in the field.
    We sent an open request for help to an electronic forum for 
doctors. The result was several useful responses. We searched a 
magazine data base for medical articles containing the key word 
"kidney." Paper copies of the most interesting finds arrived by 
mail after a few days. My wife gave them to her hospital doctor as 
background reading. 
    Kenya Saikawa is paralyzed. He communicates with his PC and 
modem using light key strokes and Morse code. Online communications 
allows Kenya to be in regular contact with people outside the walls 
of his Tokyo hospital. 
    We met online in a "Handicap Club" on a computer center called 
TWICS in Tokyo. He was there to exchange experiences with others 
with disabilities. The club is a personal support group for those 
in need of help. 
    CompuServe's Cancer Forum has a similar function. "It's a 
blessing that I can visit here 24 hours a day," one visitor said. 
"When I'm unable to sleep at night, I often sit down by the PC to 
read and write messages to others." 
    The forum is like a family. The file library is full of 
information about cancer. Members can just go in there and pick 
up whatever they want to read. 
    Dave Hughes from Old Colorado Springs, Colorado in the United 
States has had a long career as a professional soldier. He has 
fought in places like the Yalue river in Korea and Vietnam's 
jungle. When he retired, he became a political online force. 
    "I'm using the new tools of the individual mind to change the 
world," he says. Native American Indians are among those, who 
have benefited from Dave's energy and knowledge. He has helped them 
show their culture to the outside world in a graphical form. 
    Vladimir Makarenkov from the Crimea in the Ukraine is manager 
in a company called VINKO. In early 1993, he distributed an offer 
of partnership with foreign companies through the mailing list E-
EUROPE. VINKO is into aluminium processing. He wrote: 
    "From our own production we can offer some one metals and 
aniline dye for cotton, viscose, wool, silk, leather. We are 
interested in deliveries of chemical production (gamma acid, H-
acid) and not quickly deteriorating foods (food concentrates, 
canned food etc)."
    George Pavlov is Planning and Reporting manager at an American 
computer manufacturer. Daily, he logs on to online services to 
monitor industry product announcements and daily news from several 
electronic sources. It helps him stay ahead of rapid technological 
developments. 
    Semafor A/S in Arendal, Norway, produces modems and other types 
of telecommunications equipment. They operate an electronic bulletin 
board for customers, users and prospects. Anybody can call in to 
get information about products and offerings. If they need help, 
they can leave a message to Semafor A/S day and night. A response 
will be waiting for them, when they call back. 
    Eduardo Salom heads Software Plus SA in Buenos Aires, 
Argentina. He discovered the online world in 1988, and uses it to 
find information that can help his company develop industrial 
applications. 
    The Norwegian civil engineer Kai Oestreng regularly calls 
specialized online computer clubs to discuss his computational 
needs, fetch programs and monitor developments. 
    Mary Lou Rebelo was born in southern Brazil. Today, she is 
married to a Japanese and lives in Tokyo. She teaches Portuguese 
and works as a translator. The modem enables her to keep in touch 
with others around the world interested in Portuguese and Spanish 
language and culture. 
    Mike Wright teaches at St. Andrew's College in Grahamstown, 
South Africa. He integrates the online world in his teaching to 
motivate his students. His classes are involved in international 
projects with schools all over the globe. 
    In August 1991, the "Old Stalinists" made a coup d'etat in the 
Soviet Union. The news media were silenced, but they forgot the  
country's many bulletin boards. Early one morning, a foreign caller 
picked up the following messages from a Moscow BBS: 


  From:    Valery Koulkov                         
  To:      All                                    Msg #560, 00:42am

  Subject: Moscow, August 19, 23:00

  Some news from the square news RSFSR white building, 23:00. Local 
  inhabitants are very welcome for the people guarding 'white 
  building', they carry food and some garments to the square. 
  Approx. 8 tanks stand by the house under the RSFSR flags! There is 
  an information that 'white house' is surrounded by the soldiers 
  from Vysshee Desantnoye uchilische from Ryazan. The people are not 
  so desperate than some hours ago. There are more and more people.

  Subject: What's happening?

  I am a journalist on the London Daily newspaper *The Independent*, 
  and I am trying to discover whether this technology, like fax 
  machines, is being used for independent communication now that the 
  censors have clamped down on everything else. 

  Can people describe what is happening, and what they see? 
  Something similar was done on Compuserve during the Gulf War, by 
  subscribers who where in Israel and were able to describe Scud 
  missile attacks without censorship.

  Subject: Moscow events

  There is shooting near the American embassy and RSFSR state 
  building. Informer said (by phone) that he saw several victims 
  (shot and killed under the tanks. there is fire near the RSFSR 
  building. Moscow, August 21, 1:15 am 

Telecommunications played a role in this historic event. While CNN 
televised the coup, it was not the images, but the words of men 
like Yeltsin that held sway for Russian citizens. 
    Within hours of Yeltsin's statement in defiance of the coup 
leaders, handbills reproducing his statement papered the walls of 
the Moscow metro and Leningrad houses. 

You can!
--------
Online communication is not just for the privileged or those with a 
special interest in computers. It is for you, me, everybody.
    There is much to learn in the "online land," and the medium is 
fascinating. It makes learning fun. You can learn about how to use 
your computer, about your profession, other people's views about 
whatever, and more. Often, you will find reports about experiences 
and know-how that it is hard or impractical to get in other ways. 
    Some users go online to learn how to do things better. Teachers 
want to give their students a better and more motivating learning 
environment. Architects, engineers and companies want increased 
competitiveness and sales. They seek timely information about 
competitors, technologies and tools, partners and trends. 
    You can take a Masters Degree in Business Administration while 
sitting in front of your computer at home. You can join online 
seminars arranged by local or foreign educational institutes. You 
can even study at night, when the rest of your family has calmed 
down. 
    Some build their own educational programs supported by data 
bases, online forums and associations of various kinds. 
    You may feel helpless when in hospital, or when visiting your 
doctor. Knowledge about your disease will make you better equipped 
to handle the situation. The online resource is just keypresses 
away, and knowledge is power. 
    To get this power, you'll need to know what you can get from 
the online world. This book is filled with examples of what is 
available, and practical tips about how to use the offerings.

A large personal network gives strength
---------------------------------------
Most of us belong to one or several networks. They consist of 
persons that you can call on whenever you need help. Your network 
may be private, like in your family. You may be member of various 
associations, or be part of a group of people with common interests 
within a company or organization. 
    The modem allows you to be part of more personal networks than 
you can possibly cope with in the "real world." Besides, it's much 
easier to develop personal networks in the online world. 
   We have used words like "clubs" and "associations." By this we 
mean groups of people interested in helping You and in participating 
in what You happen to be interested in. 
    Today's communications technology lets us participate in 
networks in other countries at a very low cost. Many describe it as 
participation "beyond time and space." 
    Write a message and send it to a person in your network. It 
arrives in his/her "mailbox" within minutes (sometimes seconds) 
and stays there until the recipient wants to read it. This built-in 
ability to send messages to other people's electronic mailboxes 
reduces the power that time and geographical distances have over 
our lives. 
    A friend in a remote country gets out of bed nine hours after
you, but keeps going well into what, for you, is the next morning. 
No problem. You can send letters when you're awake and receive 
replies when you're asleep. 
    You can pick up and read your friend's messages the next day or 
whenever you feel like doing it. That is how two people as far 
apart as Arendal, Norway and Beijing, China could be involved in 
the development of this book. 
    Sometimes "real time" discussions are important. Consider the 
following example. CompuServe has a Diabetes Forum. You can call 
there any time, day or night, seven days a week. Whenever you feel 
like it. You will always find someone to chat with who understands 
and shares your problems. 
    Real-time chatting may become expensive, but you are free to 
decide your level of involvement. If you think that $10 spent is 
enough, then just stop there. 

What is the point?
-----------------
Thousands of commercial and noncommercial online services offer 
over 5,000 online databases. These infobases are repositories of 
electronic information. They contain full-text and reference books, 
magazines, newspapers, radio and TV shows, reports, and more. 
    In 1992, BiblioData (USA) found that around 4,000 titles (i.e., 
magazines, newspapers, etc.) were available online in full-text. 
You will find facts and figures about almost anything in the online 
world. 
    The world has over 100,000 public bulletin board systems 
(1993). Most are small information centers, running on personal 
computers using a simple computer program and modems. People call 
in to read messages and information, retrieve free software, or 
just to have a good time. 
    Most BBSes are free. Some charge a small annual fee. The 
largest board has 213 telephone lines, seven gigabytes of storage 
for letters, conferences, computer programs, and more (1993). 
    Mind you, 7 gigabytes is a lot. It is equivalent to more than 
7,000,000,000 characters, or a whopping 12,000 copies of this 
book!
    The entrepreneur sees the online world as a new, profitable 
playground. Many of them have made it their profession to search 
for information for others, and they earn a good living doing so. 
    Others advertise and sell products and services by modem. 
Some set up their own online services to sell knowledge and know-
how, be it of aqua culture, wine production, marketing, or about 
the petroleum offshore market. 
    In business, it pays to be one step ahead of the competition.
Early warnings of customers' needs, competitors' moves, and 
emerging opportunities can be turned into fortunes. It can reduce 
potential losses and help develop businesses in more profitable 
directions. 
    Turn this to your advantage. Build your own early warning 
system that monitors online information sources and networks. 

Have fun 
--------
The online world has an abundance of joke clubs, dramatic adventure 
games with multiple players, and large archives filled with computer 
game software. You can transfer these programs to your personal 
computer and be ready to play in minutes. 
    Others may feel more entertained when things get "interesting." 
Surely, those calling Moscow in August 1991 for news about the coup 
must have had a strange sensation in the stomach. 
    Some online users react quickly when dramatic events occur. 
They go online to read the news directly from the wires, from 
Associated Press, TASS, Reuters, Xinhua Press, Kyodo News and 
others. 
    Usually, the online news is coming directly to you from the 
journalists' keyboards. Often, you heard it here first. 
    Other people prefer to socialize. They meet in online "meeting 
places" to debate everything from Africa and the administration of 
kindergartens to poetry, LISP programming and compressed video for 
multimedia applications. 
    It has been claimed that increased use of online networking in 
a country can effect social changes within politics, economics, 
communication and science. It can support democratic tendencies, 
the transition to a market economy, the formation and support of 
businesses, the spreading of interpersonal and mass communication, 
the forging of invisible colleges among scientists, and breaking-up 
of traditional and closed information systems developed in some 
societies. 
    No matter whether your application is useful or just a pastime, 
online services queue up to help give your life a better content. 
    Some people fear that language might be a problem, and in 
particular if English is not their first language. Don't worry. You 
are in the driver's seat. If something is hard to understand, just 
log off to study the difficult text. Take your time. Nobody is 
watching. 
    Will you being member of the online world make you rich? 
Probably not. On the other hand, it most certainly provides the 
opportunities to help you achieve such a goal, no matter how you 
define the word "rich." 

Chapter 2: The online world
===========================

This chapter is about the structure and contents of the online 
world. You will read about Bulletin Board systems, discussion 
lists, conferencing systems, online data bases, packet data 
services, and network services like FidoNet, i-Com, Infonet, 
and the Internet. 

From papyrus to bits and bytes
------------------------------
Around 1500 B.C., the world's first library was established in Tell 
el Amaran, Egypt. Eight hundred years later, the first public 
library opened in Athens, Greece. 
    It took another two thousand years for the computer to be 
invented. The first known mention of a possible future online 
information service was printed in the Atlantic Monthly magazine in 
1945. 
    Nine years later, the Naval Ordinance Test Station opened their 
online search service in California (U.S.A.) The first full-text 
database came six years later. MEDLARS was a bibliographic database 
containing references to medical literature. From now on, things 
started to roll at a faster pace: 

    * In 1972, DIALOG (U.S.A.) opened their Educational Resources 
      Information Center and National Technical Information Service 
      databases for online searching. (Appendix 1 contains infor-
      mation about the major online services referred to in this
      book.) 
    * In 1974, Dow Jones News/Retrieval (U.S.A.) launched a 
      financial information service for stock brokers. 
    * In 1978, the first bulletin board was put into operation in 
      Chicago (U.S.A.). 
    * CompuServe (U.S.A.) launched a service for home users in 
      1979. 

The online world was born in the United States. Little happened in 
the rest of the world until the late 1980s. American companies and 
users still dominate, but they are no longer alone. 
    Today, we can access over 5,000 public databases. They are 
available from more than 500,000 online systems ("host computers") 
all over the world. 
    With so many online services, it is difficult to find our way 
through the maze of offerings. This book therefore starts with a
map of the online world. 

The structure and contents of the online world
----------------------------------------------
The online world can be described as a cake with multiple layers, 
where the information sources are the bottom layer. You - the user 
- are the marzipan figure on the top. The online world contains the 
following tiers: 

   (1) Database producers and information providers
   (2) Online service companies
   (3) Gateways and networks
   (4) The services 
   (5) The user interface
   (6) The data transport services
   (7) The User.

1. Database producers and information providers.
------------------------------------------------
I have a bulletin board system in Norway (at +47 370 31378). My BBS 
is running on a small personal computer, and offers shareware and 
public domain software. 
    Anybody can call my board to have programs transferred to their 
personal computers by modem (see appendix 2 for how to do this). 
    When you call this BBS to "download" a free program for to your 
computer's hard disk, don't expect to find one made by me. I don't
write programs. All available programs have been written by others. 
    When you call Data-Star in Switzerland, or CompuServe in the 
U.S. to read news, you may find some stories authored by these 
companies. Most of their news, however, are written by others. 
    InfoPro Technologies delivers Russian scientific and technical 
articles from "Referativnyi Zurnal" through online services like 
Orbit, Pergamon and BRS. InfoPro is not the originator. The text 
has been prepared by VINITI (the Institute for scientific and 
technical information of the xUSSR). 
    My BBS (the "Saltrod Horror Show"), Data-Star, NIFTY-Serve, 
Orbit, Pergamon, BRS, and CompuServe are online services. We call 
those who have provided the news and information on these services 
for information providers or database producers. 
    The American news agency Associated Press is an information 
provider. They write the news, and sell them to online services 
like Dialog, CompuServe, Nexis and NewsNet. These online services 
let you read the news by modem.
    The information providers sell the right to distribute their 
news. Your news reading charges may be imbedded in the online 
service's standard access rates. Some services will ask you to pay 
a surcharge when reading news. 
    Most subscribers pay US$12.80 per hour (1993) to use CompuServe 
at 2400 bits per second (bps). At this speed, you typically receive 
around 240 characters of news per second. If you access at higher 
speeds, you will have to pay more. 
    CompuServe pays Associated Press part of what they earn each 
time you read their news. There is no surcharge for reading AP news 
on this service. 
    Others charge more. To read Mid-East Business Digest through 
NewsNet, you pay a surcharge of US$72.00 per hour at 2400 bps 
(1993). Scanning newsletter headlines and conducting keyword 
searches are cheaper. You pay the the basic connect charge, which
 is US$90.00 per hour at this speed. 
    Thus, your total cost for reading Mid-East Business Digest 
amounts to US$2.70 per minute. 
    CompuServe's database service IQuest lets you search NewsNet 
through a gateway to find and read the same articles. Here, reading 
will only set you back US$21.50/hour (provided the articles are 
among the first hits in your search). 
    Many information providers also distribute information through 
grassroots bulletin boards. The Newsbytes News Network and the USA 
Today newsletter services (also in full text on Dialog and Nexis) 
are two examples. 
    The rates for reading the same article may therefore differ
considerably depending on what online service you are using. If you 
are a regular reader, shop around for the best price. 
    Information providers may have subcontractors. The Ziff-Davis 
service Computer Database Plus, a database with full-text articles 
from magazines like Datamation and Wall Street Computer Review, 
depends on them. 
    Datamation pays journalists to write the articles. Ziff-Davis 
pays Datamation for the right to distribute the articles to 
CompuServe's subscribers. CompuServe pays Ziff-Davis part of what 
you pay when reading the text. 


2. Online services
------------------
The term "online services" refers to information services  provided 
by computer systems, large or small, to owners of personal 
computers with modems. 
    What is offered, differ by system. It may include access to 
libraries of programs and data, electronic mail, online shopping 
malls, discussion forums, hardware and software vendor support, 
games and entertainment, financial data, stock market quotes, and 
research capabilities.                       
    You do not always need a phone and a modem when "dialing up." 
Some services can be accessed through leased phone lines, amateur 
radio, or other methods. 
    Check out appendix 1 for a list of major services mentioned in 
this book, with addresses, phone numbers, and a short description.
    CompuServe (U.S.A.), Twics (Japan), and Orbit (England) are 
commercial. They charge you for using their services.
    Some online services are priced like magazines and newspapers 
with a flat subscription rate for basic services. You can use this 
part of a service as much as you like within a given period. GEnie, 
CompuServe, BIX, America Online, and Delphi are among those 
offering such pricing options. 
    Other online services charge for 'connect time'. They have a 
rate per hour or minute. 
    MCI Mail uses "no cure, no pay." You only pay to send or read 
mail. To check for unread letters in your mailbox is free. 
    There are all kinds of creative pricing schemes. Some services 
have different rates for access during the day, night and weekends. 
Others have different rates for users living far away. Sometimes 
the remote subscriber pays more, in other cases less than ordinary 
subscribers. 
    Still, most online services are free. This is particularly true 
for the over hundred thousand bulletin board systems around the 
world. The owners of these services often regard them as a hobby, a 
public service, a necessary marketing expense, or do it for other 
reasons. 
    The cost of setting up and operating a bulletin board system 
is low. Consequently, the BBS systems are as varied as the people 
who run them. Each BBS has its own character. 
    My BBS is also free. I consider it an online appendix to this 
book and the articles I write. 
    National Geographic BBS in Washington, D.C., U.S.A. (tel.: +1-
202-775-6738) is run by the magazine of the same name. This board 
is also free. They regard it as a part of their marketing strategy. 
It provides them with input to the editors, and it is an easy way 
of maintaining contacts with schools. 
    Semaforum BBS in Norway is run by a company. Its purpose is 
customer support and to give information to prospective customers. 
The cost is a marketing expense.
    Some large, international online services on the Internet, 
BITNET, and UUCP are almost free. They address research and 
educational institutions and are financed by public funds. These 
services are now being made available to other users at very 
moderate rates. 
    Some users fear that using online services will increase their 
telephone costs dramatically, and especially when using services in 
other countries. This is often unjustified. Read chapter 13 and 15 
for tips about how to keep your communications costs down. 

3. Gateways and networks
------------------------
CompuServe users select the Computer Database Plus from a menu. 
This prompts CompuServe to dial another online service and lets you 
use this, as if you were still using CompuServe. You hardly notice 
the difference. You are using Computer Database Plus through a 
gateway. 
    CompuServe users searching the IQuest databases get the 
following welcome message: 

      One moment please...

      Connected to 19EASYN

            Welcome to IQuest

      (c) 1991 Telebase Systems, Inc.
         U.S. Patent No. 4,774,655

Through another gateway, CompuServe connects you to the online 
service Telebase Systems, Inc. Telebase lets you go through other 
gateways to search in databases on online services like BRS, 
MEDLINE and NewsNet. 
    While searching, you may get similar progress reports: 

            Dialing BRS
            Connect BRS
            Scanning .... Please wait
            Dialing Medline
            Connect Medline
            Scanning .... Please wait

All the time, your modem is connected to CompuServe. You are 
mentally using IQuest and not other online services. Technically, 
you are going through various gateways to reach the information 
libraries. You pay CompuServe for the privilege. In turn, they pay 
a fee to Telebase, and others. 
    You can read The New York Times on Down Jones News/Retrieval 
through gateways from MCI Mail and GEnie. 
    Accessing information through a gateway is often simpler than 
logging on to several online systems. Calling several systems 
often costs more, and it certainly takes time. 
    Users of BBSes connected to RelayNet or FidoNet can join in 
global discussions. Participants in other countries also call their 
favorite local systems. To the individual user, it looks as if they 
all use the same bulletin board system. 
    The networks that tie these boards together regularly send new 
discussion items to the other participating boards. Write "This is 
not correct!" in a distributed conference on a Norwegian FidoNet 
BBS, and others may soon read your line on San Bernardino BBS in 
Colton (Canada), Wonderland Board in Macau or the HighTech BBS in 
Sidney (Australia). 
    SciLink (Canada) administers a network for distribution of 
conferences between systems using the Caucus software system. 
Participants in Tokyo, Toronto and San Francisco can discuss as 
if they were all logged on to the same online service. 
    The main purpose may not be to make it simpler or cheaper 
for the user. One typical motive is to reduce an online service's 
own communications costs. 
    KIDLINK is a global project for children between 10 - 15 years 
of age. It allows kids to discuss through a system of electronic 
mail. 
    Part of the dialog takes place by the children sending email to 
a recipient called KIDCAFE. A message to 'the cafe' goes through 
the international networks to a host computer in North Dakota 
(U.S.A.). There, a computer program called LISTSERV distributes 
copies of the message to names on an electronic address list. 
(Conferences administered by a LISTSERV are called 'discussion 
lists'.) 
    SciLink in Toronto is one recipient. Messages forwarded from 
North Dakota are made available for users as entries in a 'local' 
conference called KIDCAFE. A user in Tokyo can read a message, as 
if it had been entered locally. If she wants to reply, her answer 
is sent back to the LISTSERV for redistribution to the world. 
    Western Michigan University (U.S.A.) is also a recipient. Here, 
another LISTSERV program is in charge of forwarding the mail to yet 
another list of (local) addresses. We call it a 'mail exploder'. 
    This mailing list has been set up by local administrators to 
reduce costs. The individual user is not allowed to receive copies 
of messages all the way from North Dakota. 
    One Michigan recipient may be a local area network. You will 
find many smart technical solutions in the online world. 
    Actually, this is how the online world got started. Two systems 
were interconnected for exchange of electronic mail. Then, another 
system was added, and another. One day it was a global network of 
computer systems. 
    Some network systems are connected by leased telephone lines. 
Other networks, like FidoNet, depend mainly on dial-up using 
regular voice-grade telephone service. Each BBS dial regularly to 
other computers in the network to send or receive mail and files. 
They may do it once per day, twice per day or whatever. 
    Then someone got the idea of interconnecting networks. FidoNet 
was connected to the UUCP network, which was connected to the 
Internet, which in turn was connected to the Bergen By Byte BBS in 
Norway, CompuServe, SciLink, MCI Mail, and various local area 
networks. 
    Today, the online world is a global web of networks. The world 
is 'cabled'. You, me and all the other modem users stand to benefit 
enormously. 

4. The services
---------------
The most popular online services are electronic mail, chat, file 
transfers, conferences and discussion forums, news, reading of 
online journals and grassroots publications, database searching, 
entertainment. The online world has an infinite number of niches, 
things that people are interested in and have fun doing. 

Electronic mail
---------------
is not just like paper mail. Email is faster, easier to edit and 
use in other applications. 
    Your mail may be private, or public. It can be 'broadcasted' to 
many by a mailing list. The principle is the same on all systems. 
    Typically, an email message is sent to your mailbox in the 
following form: 

    To:  Odd de Presno
    Subject: Happy Birthday
    Text: I wish you well on your birthday. -Ole

The mailbox systems automatically add your name (i.e., the sender's 
return email address), the creation date, and forward it to the 
recipient. If the recipient's mailbox is on another system, the 
message is routed through one or several networks to reach its 
destination. 
    Several email services offer forwarding to fax, telex or 
ordinary postal service delivery. Some offer forwarding to paging 
services. When new mail arrives in your mailbox, messages with text 
like 'MAIL from opresno@extern.uio.no' will be displayed on your 
beeper's small screen. 
    Soon, you can send electronic mail to anyone. By the turn of 
the century, it probably will be difficult to tell the difference 
between fax messages and email. The services will automatically 
convert incoming faxes to computer-readable text and pictures, so 
that you can use them in word processing and other computer 
applications. 
    Automatic language translation is another trend. You will soon 
be able to send a message in English, and have it automatically 
translated into Spanish for Spanish-reading recipients, or into 
other languages. Conference systems with automatic translation are 
already being used in Japan (English to/from Japanese). 
    One day we may also have a global email address directory. 
"What is the address of Nobuo Hasumi in Japan." Press ENTER, and 
there it is. 
    Today, the largest commercial players email vendors are MCI, 
Dialcom, Telemail, AT&T Mail and CompuServe. The fight for 
dominance goes on. 

'Chat'
------
Email has one important disadvantage. It may take time for it to be 
picked up and read by the recipient. The alternative is real-time 
conferencing, a form of direct keyboard-to-keyboard dialog between 
users. We call it 'chat'. 
    Most large systems let you chat with many users simultaneously. 
Even small bulletin boards usually have a chat feature. 
    Chat is set up in several ways. On some systems, you see each 
character on the screen once it is entered by your dialog partners. 
Other systems send entries line by line, that is, whenever you 
press ENTER or Return. Here, it may be difficult to know whether 
the other person is waiting for you to type, or if he is actively 
entering new words. 
    You will find regular chat conferences in CompuServe's forums. 
Often, they invite a person to give a keynote speech before opening 
'the floor' for questions and answers. John Sculley of Apple 
Computers and various politicians have been featured in such 
'meetings'. 
    In May 1991, the KIDLINK project arranged a full-day chat 
between kids from all over the world. Line, a 12-year old Norwegian 
girl, started the day talking with Japanese kids at the Nishimachi 
and Kanto International School in Tokyo. When her computer was 
switched off late at night, she was having an intense exchange with 
children in North America. 
    The chats took place on various online services and networks, 
including Internet Relay Chat (IRC), BITNET's Relay Chat, Cleveland 
Free-Net (U.S.A.), TWICS in Tokyo, the global network Tymnet, and 
the Education Forum on CompuServe. 
    The discussions had no moderator. This made the encounters 
chaotic at times. The kids enjoyed it, though! One-line messages 
shot back and forth over the continents conveying intense 
simultaneous conversations, occasionally disrupted by exclamations 
and requests for technical help. 
    Speed is a problem when chatting. It takes a lot of time since 
most users are slow typists. 
    If individual Messages span more than one line, there is always 
a risk that it will be split up by lines coming from others. It 
takes time to understand what goes on. 
    Users of SciLink (Canada) use a method they call 'semi-sync 
chat'. The trick is to use ordinary batch-mode conferences for 
chatting. Instead of calling up, reading and sending mail and then 
log out, they stay online waiting for new messages to arrive. 
    This approach allows you to enter multiple-line messages 
without risking that it to broken up by other messages. The flow 
of the discussion is often better, and each person's entries easier 
to understand. 

File transfers
--------------
The availability of free software on bulletin boards brought the 
online world out of the closet. Today, you can also retrieve books 
and articles, technical reports, graphics pictures, files of 
digitized music, weather reports,  and much more. 
    Millions of files are transferred to and from the online 
services each day. File transfers typically represent over 75 
percent of the bulletin boards' utilization time. Downloading free 
software is still the most popular service. 
    In June 1991, users of my BBS (which has only one phone line) 
downloaded 86 megabytes' worth of public domain and shareware 
programs. (86MB equals around 86,000,000 bytes.) In May 1993, users 
downloaded 108 megabytes distributed over 1,446 files.
    Add to this the megabytes being downloaded from hundreds of 
thousands of other bulletin boards. The number is staggering. 

    If you want to download free software: read in appendix 3 
    about how to do it. 

Downloading is simple. Just dial an online service, order transfer 
of a given file, select a file transfer protocol (like XMODEM), and 
the file comes crawling to you through the phone line. 
    Services on the Internet offer file transfer through gateways 
using a command called FTP (File Transfer Protocol). It works like 
this: 

    Say you're logging on to the ULRIK service at the University of 
    Oslo in Norway. Your objective is to download free programs 
    from a large library in Oakland, U.S.A. 
        After having connected to Ulrik, you enter the command 
    'ftp OAK.Oakland.Edu' to connect to the computer in California.
        A few seconds later, the remote host asks for your logon 
    id. You enter 'anonymous', and supply your email address as
    password. This will give you access. 
        You use the cd command (change directory) to navigate to
    the desired library catalog on the remote hard disk. You locate
    the desired file, and use a GET command to transfer the file
    to your file area on Ulrik.
        When done, you logout from the remote computer to be 
    returned to Ulrik's services. Your final job is to transfer
    the file from Ulrik to your personal computer using traditional
    methods. 

Being able to send Internet mail does not guarantee access to the 
ftp command. If ftp is unavailable, you may transfer the file by 
email using a technique called UUENCODEing. 
    Here, the file is converted before transfer into a format that 
can be sent as ordinary mail (into a seven bits, even character 
code). 
    When the file arrives in your mailbox, you 'read' it as an 
ordinary message and store the codes in a work file on your disk. 
Finally, you decode the file using a special utility program (often 
called UUDECODE). Read more about this in Chapter 12. 

Conferences and discussions
---------------------------
Online conferences have many things in common with traditional face-
to-face conferences and discussions, except that participants don't 
physically meet in the same room. They 'come' by modem and discuss 
using electronic messages (sometimes also through "Chat"). 
    There are discussions about any conceivable topic, from How to 
start your own company, Brainstorming, Architectural design, The 
Future of Education and Investments, to AIDS, The Baltic States, 
Psychology, and Cartoons. 
    Instead of calling these discussions "online conferences," some 
services use terms like echos, discussion or mailing lists, clubs, 
newsgroups, round tables, SIGs (Special Interest Groups), and 
forums. They use other terms in an attempt to make their offerings 
more attractive and exclusive. 
    Others refer to "conferences" by using the name of the software 
used to administer the discussions, like LISTSERV, PortaCom, News, 
Usenet, Caucus, or PARTIcipate. 
    On the bottom line, we're still talking email. However, while 
private mail is usually read by one recipient only, 'conference 
mail' may be read by thousands of people from the whole world. 
     All of them can talk and discuss SIMULTANEOUSLY. It is almost 
impossible for one single individual to dominate. The number of 
active participants can therefore be far larger than in 'face-to-
face' conferences. 
    The conferencing software automatically records all that is 
said. Every character. Each participant can decide what to read and 
when. He may even use the messages in other applications later on. 
Opinions and information can easily be selected and pasted into 
reports or new responses. 
    Some conferences are public and open for anybody. Others are 
for a closed group (of registered) participants. 
    They are normally structured by topic and the structure is 
influenced by the participants' behavior. If the topic is limited, 
like in "The football match between Mexico and Uruguay," it may 
start with an introduction followed by comments, questions, and 
answers like pearls on a thread. After some time the conference is 
'finished'. 
    Conferences called 'IBM PC' or 'MS-DOS' often contain so many 
different sub-topics that they seem chaotic to the outsider. The 
message subject headings typically have references to computer 
equipment (like in 'Wyse 050 or TVI 925'), requests for help (like 
in 'Need Xywrite help!'), experience reports, equipment for sale, 
news reports, etc. The sequence of messages are often illogical. 

    The contents and the quality of the discussion are what 
    separates one online conference from others.

How a conference grows into something useful, depends in part on 
the features of the software used by the online service. But this 
is much less important than the kind of people you meet there and 
their willingness to contribute. 
    Messages in the IBM Hardware Forum on CompuServe are divided 
into 11 sections. Section 2 is called Printers' utilities. If you 
have problems with an old Epson FX-80 printer, send requests for 
help to "All" (=to everybody) and store it in this section. 
    CompuServe has over one million subscribers (1993). They call 
in from all over the place to join the IBM Hardware forum. Some are 
there to show off competence (read: to sell their expertise). 
Others visit to find solutions to a problem, or simply to learn. 
    A conference with many users increases your chances of meeting 
others with relevant know-how. As always, the quality of the 
people is the first requirement of a good conference. 
    Professional 'Sysops' moderate the discussion in IBMHW. They 
get up to 15 percent of what you pay CompuServe for using their 
forum. To them, being a sysop is a profession. They use a fair
amount of time trying to make the forum a lively and interesting 
place. 
    The Printers/utilities section is not just about Epson FX-80. 
Its members have hundreds of different printers, each with their 
own set of user problems. Let's use this to explain differences 
between some conferencing systems. 
    Each message in CompuServe's forums contains the sender's name 
(his local email address), subject, date, and the text itself. We 
call this the 'bulletin board model'. Here, a message typically 
looks like this: 

   #: 24988 S10/Portable Desktops
       22-Jul-91  10:05:38
   Sb: #T5200 425meg HDD
   Fm: Gordon Norman 72356,370
   To: Menno Aartsen 72611,2066 (X)

   Menno-

   Can you share the HD specs on that 425'er...random access time, 
   transfer rate, MTBF, etc.? 

   Gordon

This message may not be of interest to you. Each day, hundreds of 
messages OUTSIDE your area of interest are being posted. You do NOT 
want to read these messages. 
    CompuServe allows selective reading of messages. You can select 
all messages containing a given word or text string in the subject 
title ('Sb:' above). You can read threads of messages from a given 
message number (replies, and replies to replies). You can read all 
messages to/from a given person, from a given message number, and 
from a given date. There are many options.
    The PARTIcipate conferencing software functions diametrically 
different from CompuServe's forum software. PARTI is used on TWICS 
(Japan), Unison (U.S.A.), NWI (U.S.A.), and The Point (can be 
accessed through a gateway from CompuServe). 
    PARTI lets the user log on using an alias. For example, he can 
use the identity 'BATMAN'. You may never get to know the true name 
of the other person. On the other hand, this allows people to talk 
about controversial topics, which they would otherwise not want to 
have their names associated with. 
    Anyone can start a conference. It can be public, private or a 
combination. Combination conferences allow public review of the 
messages in the conference, but restrict the number of people who 
can contribute to the discussion. 
    Enter 'write', and PARTI will prompt you with "Enter the text 
of your note, then type .send or .open to transmit." Enter the 
welcome text for your new conference, like in this example: 

    "This conference is based on a series of articles about 
    shareware and public domain programs for MSDOS computers, which 
    I wrote for publication in England.
    Since the editor cheated me and they never reached the printing 
    press, I've decided to make them available online instead of 
    letting them rot on my hard disk. Join to read, discuss or 
    (hopefully) enjoy! "
 
When done, I entered ".open odd de presno", added the name of the 
conference ("MSDOS TIPS") and a short description ("GOOD PD AND 
SHAREWARE PROGRAMS"). 
  
The conference was presented to the other PARTI users on TWICS like 
this: 

    "MSDOS TIPS" by ODD DE PRESNO, Feb. 23, 1990 at 11:57 about 
    GOOD PD AND SHAREWARE PROGRAMS (7 notes)

Few systems of the bulletin board model let users start their own 
conferences at will. All new topics must be stored in a given 
structure. The administrators (sysops) of the service manage the 
evolution of the 'conference room'. After a while, old messages may 
even be deleted to make room for new. 
    In PARTI, conference messages are organized under a topic, or 
any sub-topics that can be derived from the main topic. 
    Conferences are modeled after their counterparts in the face-
to-face world. They start with an introduction followed by a 
discussion about a narrow topic, like here:

  "SMART PEOPLE" by MACBETH on Jan. 4, 1992 at 12:27, about WHO ARE 
  THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST (504 characters and 17 notes). 

In this example above, the welcome message is 504 characters long. 
Following that, there are 17 other messages (called notes). 
    Notes are stored without individual subject headers and the 
name of a recipient. Everything is posted to 'the group'. 
    If CompuServe message above had been posted on PARTI, then the 
first five lines might have been reduced to: 

 12 (of 12) SHABBY DOG Jul. 22, 1991 at 10:05 (119 characters)

On PARTI, all participants read all notes. Selective reading must 
be done in other ways (by searching conference contents). 
    These two conferencing models seem to attract different types 
of discussions. PARTI has given birth to more discussions on topics 
like these (from PARTI on The Point, January 1992): 

  "HELLO BEEP" by THE SHADOW on Sept. 17, 1991 at 19:20, about 
  BEEP'S ADVENTURES IN JAPAN, AND THE LIKE (840 characters and 22 
  notes). 

  "MEMORIES" by LOU on Dec. 21, 1991 at 12:31, about .......I 
  REMEMBER WHEN...... (423 characters and 1 notes). 

  "AMENDMENT II 1991" by PASSIN THRU on Dec. 25, 1991 at 20:55, 
  about OUR RIGHTS TO OWN AND POSSESS FIREARMS, AND THE MYTH 
  REGARDING ASSAULT WEAPONS. (3036 characters and 38 notes). 

  "TV SHOWS" by THE SHADOW on Nov. 16, 1990 at 18:00, about 
  DISCUSSION OF TELEVISION SHOWS (105 characters and 37 notes). 

  "PHILOSOPHY FOR AMATEURS" by MACBETH on April 13, 1990 at 10:08, 
  about TALKING ABOUT THINKING (187 characters and 97 notes). 

  "HAPPY BIRTHDAY TOTO" by PONDER on Jan. 2, 1992 at 14:34, about 
  AND I BET HE THOUGHT I FORGOT. (86 characters and 15 notes). 

  "ONLINE LOTTERY" by DEEDUB on Jan. 3, 1992 at 07:40, about 
  MULTIPLYING OUR CHANCES TO WIN THE LOTTERY (1238 characters and 
  62 notes). 

  "WHO SHOT KENNEDY" by MATT on Jan. 3, 1992 at 22:29, about THE 
  ASSASINATION OF JOHN F. KENNEDY; THOUGHTS, COMMENTS, QUESTIONS 
  AND THEORIES! (529 characters and 83 notes). 

  "THE ECONOMY" by LOU on Jan. 5, 1992 at 16:40, about THE ECONOMY, 
  AS IT AFFECTS US ALL. (167 characters and 49 notes). 

  "PUERTO RICO" by PACKER on Jan. 18, 1992 at 20:47, about PARA 
  DISCUTIR ASUNTOS PUERTORIQUENA (166 characters and 9 notes). 

Systems using the bulletin board model rarely have conferences like 
"MEMORIES." In PARTI, one-note conferences are allowed to stay. In 
the bulletin board environment, they soon disappear. 
    You can probably still join MEMORIES on the Point to add your 
own feelings or point-of-views. 
    In larger PARTI conferences, the notes can be read like a 
book. Often, side discussions appear like 'branches' on a 'tree'. 
Join and read them, if you want to. Or just pass. 
    The bulletin board systems (including CompuServe's forums) and 
PARTIcipate are at two extremes of the spectrum of conference 
systems. Toward the BBS model, there are systems like FidoNet Echo, 
RBBS-PC, and PortaCom. Toward the PARTI side, there are systems like 
Caucus. 

Many companies set up bulletin board systems to provide technical 
support to customers. McAfee Associates, Inc. in California is one 
example. They offer technical information, help, upgrade software, 
list of agents, technical bulletins with lists of products, and new 
products through agents' support BBSes all over the world. For 
example, when in Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago call the Opus 
Networx BBS at (819) 628-4023. 
    Setting up a professional BBS is not very expensive. You can 
easily have 32 people online to the same conference simultaneously 
on a standard 80386-based PC, running Xenix and Caucus conferencing 
software. This is what the Washington Information Service Corp. in
U.S.A. did. There's an abundance of software to choose from. 
    Many companies rent private 'conference rooms' on commercial 
online services rather than doing it in-house. The advantage is 
easier access to an established multi-user system and user base. 
    Microsoft, Toshiba, Quarterdeck, Digital Research, Tandy, 
Novell  and hundreds of others rent public support forum space on 
CompuServe to keep in touch with customers all over the world. 
Others rent space on regional bulletin boards. 
    Other corporate applications of such services include internal 
organizational development and communications, and coordination of 
projects. 
    On Norwegian bulletin boards the main language is Norwegian. In 
France, expect French. Local systems usually depend on messages in 
the local language. 
    Services catering to a larger geographical area often have a 
different policy. English is the most common language for 
international discussions. Spanish possibly number two. Example: 
TWICS in Japan is an English language system. Its Spanish language 
conference ESPANOL has participants from Japan, Mexico and Norway.  
    On MetaNet (Arlington, U.S.A.) the conferences are divided into 
conference areas. One area was called The Salon. The welcome 
message said: 'All conferences and responses posted here may freely 
be ported to other conferencing systems'. MetaNet regularly 'ports' 
(exchanges) conference notes with systems in Europe, Asia and North 
America. 
    Exchanging conferences have long traditions in the bulletin 
board world. To some, it is routine to call Thunderball Cave BBS in 
Oslo to discuss photography with people in California. New messages 
are exchanged daily across country boundaries. 
    The global web of connections between computers enables us to 
discuss with people living in other parts of the world, as if they 
were living next door. 

Things Take Time!
-----------------
How long does it take a message to get from Hyougo in Japan to 
Saltrod in Norway? Or to Dominique Christian in Paris? 
    Sometimes, mail travels from mailbox service to mailbox service 
in seconds. That is usually the case with messages from my mailbox 
in Norway to KIDLINK's LISTSERV in North Dakota, U.S.A. 
    Messages that must go through many gateways may take more time. 
How long it takes, depends on the degree of automation in the mail 
systems involved, and how these systems have been connected to the 
global matrix of networks. 
    Speed is high if the computers are interconnected with fixed, 
high-capacity lines. This is not so for mail from Oslo to Dominique 
in Paris. His mail is routed through a system in London and is 
forwarded once per day through a dial-up connection. It usually 
takes at least one day to reach the destination. 

News
----
Most large news agencies have online counterparts. You can often
read their news online before it appears in print. This is the case 
with news from sources like NTB, Agence France-Presse, Associated 
Press, Kyodo News Report (Japan), Reuters, Xinhua English Language 
News Service (China) and TASS. Some news is only made available in 
electronic form. 
    News may be read in several ways, depending on what online 
service you use: 
    * From a list of headlines. Enter a story's number to receive 
its full text. The news may be split up into groups, like Sports, 
International news, Business, and Entertainment. 
    * Some services let you hook directly into a news agency's 
'feed line' to get news as it is being made available. At 11.02, 
11.04, 11.15, etc. 
    * News may be 'clipped' and stored in your mailbox twenty-four 
hours a day, seven days a week. Clipping services search articles 
for occurrences of your personal keyword phrases while you're 
offline. In this way, you can monitor new products, companies, 
people, and countries, even when you're not online. 
    NewsFlash is NewsNet's electronic clipping service, a powerful 
resource that lets you monitor NewsNet's newsletters for topics of 
interest. 
    On the Executive News Service (CompuServe), you can search for 
words in story headlines. You can also search for first three lines 
of text from 8,000 stories/day from Washington Post, OTC NewsAlert, 
Associated Press, United Press International and Reuters Financial 
News Wire. 
    Newspapers used to receive news through the wires before the 
online user. This built-in delay has now been removed on many 
services. Industry and professional news is usually available 
online long before it appears in print. 

Databases
---------
Some years ago, most databases just contained references to 
articles, books and other written or electronic sources of 
information. The typical search result looked like this: 

  0019201     02-88-68
    TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE  in  CYST  Fluid  from  Autosomal  
    Dominant POLYCYSTIC KIDNEYS. 
    Elzinga L.W.; et al. W.M.  Bennett, Dept. of Med., Oregon Hlth. 
    Sci. Univ., 3101 Southwest Sam Jackson Park Rd., Portland, 
    OR 97201. 

  Kid. Int.   32:  884-888.  Dec.  1987

  Subfile:  Internal  Medicine;  Family Practice;  Nephrology;  
  Infectious Disease; Clinical Pharmacology; Highlights of General 
  Medicine 

You had to take the reference to a library to get a print copy of 
the article. Some services let you to order a copy while online, to 
be sent you by mail from a copying service. 
    Full-text searching is now the rule. When you find an article 
of interest, you can have the full text displayed on your screen at 
once (normally without accompanying pictures and tables, though). 
The search commands are simpler and more powerful. 

Just for fun
------------
Many online services focus on your leisure time. They offer reviews 
and news about movies, video, music, and sport. There are forums 
for stamp and coin collectors, travel maniacs, passionate cooks, 
wine tasters, and other special interest groups. Besides, many 
services are entertaining in themselves. 
    Large, complex adventure games, where hundreds of users can 
play simultaneously, are popular choices. People sit glued to the 
computer screen for hours. 
    'Chat', this keyboard-to-keyboard contact-phone type of
simultaneous conversation between from two and up to hundreds of 
persons, is also popular. It works like a combination of a social 
activity and a role-playing/strategy/fantasy/skill-improving game. 
    Shopping is the online equivalent of traditional mail order 
business. The difference is that you can buy while browsing. Some
commercial services distribute colorful catalogues to users to 
support sales. Some distribute pictures of the merchandise by 
modem. 
    You can buy anything from racer fitness equipment and diamonds 
to cars. Enter your credit card number and the Chevrolet is yours. 
The online mail order business is becoming increasingly global. 

Level 5: The user interface
---------------------------
This term describes how the online service is presented to you, 
that is, in what form text, pictures and sound appear on your 
personal communications computer. 
    Most online services offer the first three of these four 
levels. Some offer more: 

    1. Menus for novices. The user can select (navigate) by 
       pressing a figure or a letter.
    2. Short menus or lists of commands for the intermediate user.
       The user knows some about how the service works, and just 
       wants a short reminder to help navigate. 
    3. A short prompt (often just a character, like a "!"), which 
       tells the expert user where he is in the system right now.
       Those knowing the service inside out, don't need reminders 
       about what word or command to enter at this point. 
    4. Some services offer automatic access without any menus or 
       visible prompts at all. Everything happens in a two-way 
       stream of unintelligent data. The only menus that the user 
       sees, are those belonging to the program running on his 
       personal computer. 

Some services emphasize colors, graphics and sound. They may 
require that users have certain hardware or special add-on cards 
in their communications computer. Often, a special communications 
program is also needed. 
    Other services use methods for presenting colors and graphics 
already built into their users' computers (and programs). 
    Colors, graphics and sound are highly desirable in some 
applications, like online games and weather forecasts. But even 
where it is not important, there will always be many wanting it. 
    To the professional on a fact-gathering mission, these features 
may give slower data transfer and problems when saving text to disk 
for later use. Therefore, many prefer ASCII text with no extras. 
    Sports cars are nice, but for delivering furniture they're 
seldom any good. The same applies to the user interfaces. No one is 
perfect for all applications. 

Level 6: The data transporters
------------------------------
When the online service's host computer is far away, the user often 
faces the challenges of: 

    1. Noise on the line, which may result in unreadable text or 
       errors in the received material. 
    2. Expensive long distance calls

There are many alternatives to direct long distance calling. Some 
offers better quality data transfers and lower costs. 
    The regional packet data services used to be a popular option. 
In Scandinavia, the offerings of the local PTTs are called Datapak. 
Similar services are offered in most countries, often by a national 
telephone monopoly. 
    Competitively priced alternatives are appearing in many 
countries as national telecom monopolies are brought to an end. For 
example, Infonet, TRI-P, and i-Com compete successfully with former 
monopolies for transport of data to and from North America. 
    The Internet is a global network serving millions of mailboxes. 
It provides very cost-efficient mail exchange with private and 
public networks throughout the world. 
    IXI is a packet data network operated by European Research 
centers. DASnet offers transport of mail between mail systems that 
have no direct connection with each others. (More about this in 
Chapter 13.) 

Level 7: The user
-----------------
This is you and me. Turn the page to the next chapter and read 
about how to use the online services. 

Chapter 3: How to use the online services
=========================================

The user interface refers to what you get on your computer screen 
and how, when you call an online service. It includes menus and 
help screens, and various options to tailor the service to your 
personal preferences. 

Navigating by menus is simpler
------------------------------
Most online services have menus to make them easier for novices to 
use.  A typical menu looks like this: 

    R)ead messages
    Q)uick search available messages 
    W)rite messages
    C)omments to Sysop
    D)ownload programs
    ?) for help
    G)oodbye. This is enough!

Enter a letter (or ?) to select a function. Enter R to read 
messages. There is hardly any need to read the documentation to 
use this service. 
    CompuServe greets European users with this menu:

You can "go" to Associated Press' newswires or the section for 
home-schooling in the Education Forum by entering numbers listed in 
menus. The service is like a tree with menus by every set of 
branches. 
    A code in the upper right-hand corner of each screen tells you 
exactly where you are. The last menu has the code 'TOP' meaning 
that this menu is at the 'top of the tree'. 
    By each CompuServe system prompt, the command GO followed by a 
destination code will take you directly to a desired location. 
Enter GO IBMHW to go directly to the IBM Hardware Forum. 
    The GO command will save you time and money. Similar codes and 
commands are used on several other online services. 
    On many systems, the first menu encountered when logging on is 
a list of announcements and new offerings. The following is from 
GEnie, General Electric's Consumer Information Service (U.S.A.): 

       GEnie Announcements (FREE)       

 1. July 1991 GEnie Billing Completed.  To review yours, type:....*BILL
 2. Hot Summer Nights continues to SIZZLE.........................*HSN

Enter #, <H>elp, or <CR> to continue?

At the 'Enter #' prompt, enter '7' to go directly to the "Future of 
Online Gaming" conference (RTC=Round Table Conference). Enter H for 
Help, or press Return to get to the systems' main menu. 
    You can "go" to selected services by entering a videotext page 
number code or a number (selected from the menu). Type 'mail' to 
get to your mailbox, 'backgammon' to play, or 'SEARS' to visit the 
online version of this North American shoppers' paradise. 
    'Mail' has page number 200. Enter 'm 200' to go there directly. 
To go to NewsBytes' technical news reports by subject, select "5" 
from menu page number 316. 
    GEnie even has a faster way. Like some other services, it let
you stack commands. Instead of issuing one command, and then wait 
for the system to respond before issuing the next command, stacking 
allows you to put all commands on one line. The command "m 316;5" 
will take you directly to choice 5 from the menu on page 316 
without displaying intermediate menus. 
    Many online services use the same template. They have commands 
like GO SERVICE-NAME, JOIN SERVICE-NAME (or just J), DELTA SERVICE-
NAME, or just the code or name of the offering as in 'mail' and 
'sears' above. 
    Entering H or ? (for help) usually give you assistance. Few 
services are fussy about whether you use lower or capital letters 
in commands. 
    On some services, and especially if a selection requires just 
a letter or a number, you don't even have to press return to make 
it happen. This method is used on many bulletin boards. 
    Some codes are standard. This is particularly the case with "?", 
H, or Help for more information. 

Test drive
----------
Several commercial systems let you try the service for free or at 
lower rates. You can check what's out there without paying for the 
exploratory connect time, and get some free training in how to use 
the service. 
    CompuServe's Practice Forum (GO PRACTICE) does not carry any 
connect charges, but applicable communication surcharges are still 
in effect. They also have a free 'Guided Tour'. 
    Free trials are particularly useful before a search in an 
expensive database. Use DialIndex on Dialog. Orbit has DBIN (The
database Index), and Data-Star has CROS. They are master indexes to 
the databases on the system. First, select a general subject area, 
then enter your search terms. The systems will respond with lists 
of databases and hit counts. 
    Note: You must go to the 'real' databases for results. You 
cannot retrieve actual information during a test drive. 

Selecting an expert level
-------------------------
Most services regard all new users as novices. The software 
designers assume that users don't want (or are unable) to read 
lengthy explanations. They think that most users prefer navigation 
by going from menu to menu. 
    Commercial services may support this view for financial 
reasons, and especially when charging for access by the minute. 
(Some of them let you read their help screens for free, though.) 
    Menus are important when browsing new offerings, or accessing 
services that we seldom use. Frequent users of a service, however, 
quickly learn how to do things. Menus may soon begin to annoy 
rather than please. Reading them costs money, and it slows our 
communications down. 
    We do not need menus when accessing online services in fully 
automated mode. Your communications program remembers exactly what 
to do, and does all the typing for you. 
    There is no point in paying extra for having menus. You'll not 
read them anyway. The objective is to access the service at maximum 
speed and the lowest possible cost. 
    Most online services can be tailored to your personal needs and 
preferences. Many let you choose between:

    * Full menus
    * Short menus
    * A prompt line with a list of the most often used 
      commands, 
    * a prompt character or word (see "prompt" in appendix 4
      for examples). Prompts can be used by automatic
      communication script files to trigger the next action.

If concerned about costs, note that you can use expert mode without 
being a true expert. Just print the menus, and keep them by your 
keyboard while moving around. 
    Some users draw 'road maps' of the services to navigate more 
quickly. Others automate the process using automatic communications 
scripts. 

Tailoring your services
-----------------------
The need to tailor the online service's prompts and menus differs 
considerably from user to user, as they use all kinds of computers 
for communication. 
     Some screens are large. Other screens can only display a few 
lines of text at a time. One user of my BBS even used a Hewlett 
Packard pocket calculator with a tiny, tiny screen. 
     Many online services allow you to tailor the way information 
is sent to you. 
     If you are satisfied with how things are, skip the next couple 
of pages and read from "Connecting the first time." If curious of 
your options, read on for a somewhat brief and technical overview. 
     Besides a selection of various types of menus, you can usually 
also set the following preferences: 

    * What menu is to be the first, when you access the service?
    * The first menu is to be a tailored menu containing your
      favorite offerings, and nothing else.
    * Colors, graphics, or no colors/graphics. 
    * Preferred file transfer protocol (to avoid a question each 
      time you want to transfer a file).
    * Desired terminal emulator, like TTY, VT-100 or VT-52.
    * CAPITAL LETTERS or Mixed Case.
    * What ASCII character code to use for the DELETE function.
    * How many spaces to insert when expanding TABs in your mail.
    * Number of lines per screen (for example, 24 on an IBM PC, or 
      eight on a TRS-80 Model 100. Whether scrolling is to pause 
      after each screenful or not.)
    * Number of characters per line (for example, 80 lines on a PC, 
      or 40 on a TRS-80 Model 100.
    * If the linefeed character is to be sent or not.
    * If blank lines are to be sent.
    * Whether the service is to check when you log on to see if 
      you're using special software (as in 'Inquire for VIDTEX' on 
      CompuServe). 
    * The use of 'echo'. Is the service to return the characters 
      that you enter on your keyboard?
    * Use of delay when sending linefeeds. (Useful if capturing 
      text to a dumb printing terminal. If text scrolls too fast 
      for the printer, you risk losing some of it.) 
    * Choice of prompt character, or prompt text string. This is
      useful when communicating by script files. On CompuServe, I 
      have asked the system to add the BackSpace character (ASCII 
      character number 8) to the end of all forum prompts. Since
      this character is rarely found in messages or other texts,
      I can safely let scripts depend on this prompt character for 
      unattended communication. 

Displaying information on the screen
------------------------------------
An 'A' is not an 'A' no matter what service you use. If you call 
Tocolo BBS in Japan (Tel.: +81-3-205-9315. 1200 bps, 8,N,1.) with a 
non-Japanese MS-DOS computer, chances are that the welcome text 
will look like this: 

  *--------------------------------------------------------------*
  *  D0:[ BBS    (<^/9] 7.8)                                     *

  *                    (Wed 9:00-17:00 J R]C I @R 5T=P C^=)      *
  *--------------------------------------------------------------*

You'll need a Japanese ROM (Read-Only Memory) in your computer, a 
special graphics program, or a Japanese language operating system  
to have the Kanji characters displayed properly on your screen. 
    The characters that you see on your computer's screen are based 
on a code. The computer finds the characters to display from a 
table built into your system's hardware or software. 
     Most personal computers can be preset to use various tables 
depending on your needs. When communicating in English, you may 
want it to show Latin characters. When writing in Japanese, you 
may want it to display Kanji characters. 
     Those writing in Norwegian, often want to use the special 
Scandinavian characters . If the first two of these Nordic 
characters read like the symbols for Yen and Cent, you're not set 
up for Scandinavian characters. If your system is set up correctly, 
they should look like an 'o' and an 'O' overwritten by a '/'. 
    The code telling your computer what to display, may also 
contain information about where to put characters and what colors 
to use. 
    Thus, an online service may order your computer to display a 
given character in column 10 on line 2, and to print it in blinking 
red color. If you're not set up correctly, these codes may show as 
garbage on your screen rather than as a colorful character in a 
given position. 
    If you call a service set to display text in VT-52 format, and 
your communications program is set accordingly, then you should be 
OK. VT-52 is a setup that makes a program or a service 'behave' 
like a DEC VT-52 terminal. 
    Being able to view VT-52 coded text on your screen, does not 
guarantee that you can capture this 'picture' to a file on your 
disk. Your communications program may need special features to do 
that. If these features are missing, you are in for a surprise. The 
text in your capture file may look like in this example (it came on 
a single, long line on my computer):

The character '*' in this example refers to the ESCape character 
(ASCII number 27). ESC is used to tell your computer that what 
follows is a VT-52 display command. 
    The codes following the ESC say where text is to be printed on 
your screen (from line number x and column number y). 
    If your communications program cannot save VT-52 coded text in 
a readable way, you'll need auxiliary programs to remove or convert 
the codes. Some communication programs let you take snapshots of 
the screen, and store the result in a file. This usually gives good 
results, but it may be a cumbersome approach. 
    Prestel (British Telecom, England) belongs to a group of online 
services called videotex (or viewdata). Minitel (in France and the 
U.S.), Alex (Canada), and Prodigy (U.S.A.) are also in this group. 
They believe that beautiful color graphics, large characters, and 
menus give them a competitive advantage. 
    CompuServe is often called a videotex service because of its 
emphasis on menus. However, most call it 'ASCII videotex' as it is 
not depending on special display formats. Their philosophy is that 
'plain text' is required to attract many users across hardware 
platforms. 
    The viewdata services use graphical display standards with 
names like Prestel, CEPT, Captain (Character and Pattern Telephone 
Access Information Network System, in Japan), Telidon (Canada), 
Minitel, Teletel (France), GIF (the Graphics Interchange Format), 
Viewdata, and NAPLPS (The North American Presentation Level 
Protocol Syntax). 
    You often need special terminal machines to use some viewdata 
services. On other services, you must use special software plus an 
emulator card in your computer. 
    Users of the communications program Procomm Plus can buy a 
Viewdata module for conversion of Prestel videotex text to plain 
ASCII, i.e., plain text without imbedded special codes. 
    Many MS-DOS based bulletin boards let you set access defaults 
to colors and graphics. Most of them use ANSI graphics in welcome 
texts and menus. Users of Procomm must set their program to ANSI 
BBS to take advantage. 
    Capture these welcome texts and menus to a file on your hard 
disk, and view them with an editor. They are filled with ANSI 
escape codes, and thus hard to read (and search). The good news is 
that conference and forum mail only rarely contains such codes. 
    Many users routinely keep captured online information on their 
hard disks for later reference. If this is your intention, make 
sure that text is sent to you in plain ASCII, or TTY mode. 

    TTY sends one line at a time, and only uses the codes TAB, 
    BackSpace, Carriage Return and LineFeed during the transfer. 
    The rest is 'plain text'. 

Most online services offer TTY format. You can use the setting 
almost everywhere. Even the videotex service Prestel offers an 
option called 'TTY Teletype'. 
    If 'TTY' or 'ASCII' is not on your online services' list of 
options, try 'Others' or 'Other computers'. These settings usually 
identify your computer as unable to handle 'standard' colors, sound 
and graphics. 
    Viewdata pages may provide "selling pictures," but the screens 
often have a low contents of information compared with TTY-based 
services. They are therefore not my favorite services for news in 
full-text. 
    In other applications, like games, colorful graphics are a 
definite advantage. 

Connecting the first time
-------------------------
If you have unlimited financial resources, go ahead and call up 
services all over the world. Learning by doing is exciting. 
    If resources are limited, start by reading user information 
manual. Or, go online to capture key menus and help texts. Print 
them out on paper for further study before going online again for 
a 'real' visit. 
    I always hurry slowly during my first visits to a new online 
service. I call up, capture information about how to use it, and 
disconnect. It may take me days to study the material. My objective 
is to find what the service has to offer in order to plan how to 
use it most efficiently. 
    The first important command to look up is the logoff command. 
There is nothing more frustrating than entering "bye" only to get
an error message. If lost, try "quit", "exit", "logoff", "off" and 
"G", in the hope of finding the correct command. These are the 
most usual variations. You should also try HELP or "?". 
    If you really can't figure out how to get off a system, just 
hang up on it. Be careful, though. Some systems will continue to 
charge for a period, even after you have disconnected by hanging up. 
    One of the first things that I do, is set my options to expert 
status, though I am obviously an amateur at this stage. 
    Often, I also start automating the process during my first 
visits. I write script files for automatic access and quick 
navigation to key offerings. Another good strategy is to look for 
automated offline readers or systems (see Chapter 16 for details). 
    Others prefer paper and pencil. They write a list of required 
commands on a piece of paper, like this: 

    Call 0165
    At CONNECT:                   ENTER @SP ENTER
    At the NUI prompt:            Nxxxxxppppp-a170041
    At Enter 'dix' and <Enter>:   dix
    At -- More --:                ENTER
    At Your name:                 Odd de Presno
    At Password:                  hemmelig
    At What do you want to do:
    - when no unread mail         goodbye
    - when mail to read           ENTER

Put the list by your keyboard before calling the service. Follow it 
carefully. After a while you may remember the procedure, and can 
throw away your notes. 

    Good luck!

Chapter 4: Hobby, games and fun
===============================

  * Programs, game and fun
    Online adventure games. The virus threat.
  * Hobbies. Holiday travels. Collecting stamps or coins.
    Roots, music, and online shopping.

Online services have one thing in common with newspapers, magazines 
and books. What they offer, varies from provider to provider. 
    The next chapters will focus on the contents of the offerings. 
Appendix 1 has details about how to access the major service 
providers. 
    Small online services often have interesting offerings in 
specialized areas, and especially when they are based on local 
phenomena or events. They tend to be more personal. They often 
present their 'wares' in a local language, and offer very large 
collections of free software. 
    The large online services have hundreds of thousands of users. 
The activity is often high. They usually attract interesting (and 
competent) participants to their conferences and forums, have more 
programs available for download and more news sources and databases 
to search. They generally give you a wider choice. 
    We will focus on the large international services. These are 
available from anywhere without too much effort, and using them 
comes surprisingly cheap. Therefore, please remember that this book 
just covers the top of the iceberg. Cheaper services may be found 
elsewhere, and they may even be better tuned to your particular 
areas of interest. 

Locating game software
----------------------
The fastest, easiest and cheapest is to call an online service to 
download game programs. You'll find an overwhelming number of 
programs for all types of microcomputers. 
    Many games are free. We call them "Public Domain" or "Freeware" 
programs. Others are distributed free. You do not have to pay to 
get them and try them out. If you want to use them, however, the 
copyright owner expects you to pay a fee. We call them "shareware" 
or "user supported" programs. 
    When the game has been transferred to your personal computer, 
you can play without worries about communications costs, or the 
busy signal on your phone line. 
    My favorite game is shareware. The name is Arachnid. It is an 
MS Windows solitaire game (patience) made by SP Services, P.O. Box 
456, Southampton, SO9 7XG, England. The desired registration fee is 
UKP 15.00 (English pounds). You can download the program from my 
board as WINCARD.EXE. The file is 106 kilobytes large. 
    WINCARD.EXE is a special distribution file, which contains 
three games and all supporting files. The EXE extension may fool 
you into thinking that it is a program, and in a way it is. The 
file is a self-extract file, meaning that you just enter "WINCARD" 
on an MS-DOS computer to extract the game files from the "package." 
    Games are usually distributed in such distribution files. All 
files used by a game (or several games) is put into one file by 
special software, and compressed in size. This makes retrieval of 
programs easier and cheaper. You do not have to download many 
related files individually. The transfer takes less time. (Read 
about how to extract programs from distribution files in appendix 
3). 
    You will find some of the largest collections of games on the 
North American services CompuServe and EXEC-PC BBS. You will also 
find many throughout the Internet. 

  | TRICKLE is a large collection of public domain and shareware   |
  | programs for MS-DOS, CPM, and other computers. For information |
  | about how to use TRICKLE, send a message through Internet to   |

  |                                                                |
  | If TRICKLE is not enough, try Archie. It is the Internet       |
  | archive server listing service. The Archie database maintains  |
  | a list of roughly 1.5 million files containing 100 Giga-       |
  | bytes (that is, 100,000,000,000 bytes) of information          |
  | available from over 800 anonymous FTP archive sites.           |
  |     You can search this database by email to find where files  |
  | are located. Some Archie systems maintain a list of libraries  |
  | all over the world, while others concentrate on a more limited |
  | geographical area.                                             |
  |     Once Archie has told you where desired programs and files  |
  | are located, you can retrieve them by telnet, anonymous FTP,   |
  | of FTPmail. Read "File transfers through the Internet" in      |

  | Getting programs by email is a three-step process:             |
  | (1) Use Archie to find file names and where they are stored,   |
  | (2) Send a message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com to have them      |
  |     retrieved and forwarded to you by email, and               |
  | (3) Use a utility program to convert the file to a useful      |
  |     format. (See chapter 12.)                                  |
  |                                                                |
  | Check out JVArcServ for an Archie-alike service on FidoNet.    |

Chances are that online services in your area also have many 
programs to offer. Most free bulletin boards have more software 
than you'll ever get around to try. 
    Usually, there is a natural specialization between boards. 
Those using the Unix operating system, have the largest number of 
programs for such machines. Those running on MS-DOS computers, have 
more programs for such computers. 
    Some games are trite and bad. Others are brilliant. There are 
ladder games, games challenging your responses (racer car driving, 
flight control, war games, subsea games), electronic versions of 
traditional games like Backgammon, Yatzy, chess and bridge, 
educational games (geography, mathematics and history), puzzles, 
fractal programs (drawing beautiful pictures on your screen), 
psychological tests, text-based adventure games, and other strange 
and funny creations. Here is something for any taste or belief. 
    If you want to get rich in a hurry, pick programs that increase 
chances of winning horse race bets, or other "real world" money 
winning games. 
    If you're into beautiful girls, fill your hard disk with 
picture files in GIF, PCX or other graphics formats. (Sorry ladies, 
there are not many pictures of naked boys around.) You'll also find 
software that will display the pictures that you just retrieved. 
    Keen users of the more popular games often want to swap tricks 
and discuss experiences: Super Nintendo players regularly meet on 
the SNES mailing list (on SNES@spcvxa.spc.edu). To join, send your 
subscription request to: SNES-Request@spcvxa.spc.edu . 
    For chess, try the Chess Discussion List (CHESS-
L@GREARN.BITNET) unless Chinese Chess (on XIANGQI@INDYCMS.BITNET) 
is what you're looking for. CompuServe has a Chess forum (GO 
CHESSFORUM) with message sections called: Chess Basics, Theory & 
Analysis, News Wire, Hardware/Software, Casual Games, Electronic 
Knights, Oriental/Variants, Tourneys (Open), USCF Rated Games, Team 
Play, and Time Out. 
    Usenet excels when it comes to games:

  rec.gambling            Articles on games of chance & betting.
  rec.games.board         Discussion and hints on board games.
  rec.games.board.ce      The Cosmic Encounter board game.
  rec.games.bridge        Hobbyists interested in bridge.
  rec.games.chess         Chess & computer chess.

With so many games and programs around, it is difficult to stay 
current about new programs and new versions of old ones. Consider 
subscribing to the MS-DOS Archive Additions (one-way) information 
service. Internet MS-DOS archive managers use it to announce new 
additions to their collections. 
    To subscribe, send a message to LISTSERV@TACOM-EMH1.Army.Mil 
with this command in the body of the message:                                                       
            

      subscribe msdos-ann                                                      

These announcements are also posted to the Usenet newsgroup called
comp.archives.msdos.announce .

  | It is probably easier for you to relate to references like     |
  | "rec.games.video on Usenet," than to XIANGQI@INDYCMS.BITNET.   |
  | References to BITNET mailing lists are made in various ways    |
  | throughout the book, just as it is online. This is the basic   |
  | rule:                                                          |
  |                                                                |
  | All BITNET mailing lists are 'managed' by a LISTSERV program,  |
  | which handles all subscription requests. When you read a       |
  | reference like XIANGQI@INDYCMS.BITNET, then that means that    |
  | a subscription request must be set to the LISTSERV at the      |
  | INDYCMS computer on BITNET. Mail to the forum, however, must   |
  | be sent to XIANGQI@INDYCMS.BITNET to be forwarded to the       |
  | other members.                                                 |
  |                                                                |
  | For more information about these strange address codes, and    |
  | how to use them, read about BITNET in appendix 1. You may      |
  | find it useful to read about email addresses in Chapter 7.     |
  |                                                                |
  | All BITNET mailing lists can be used by email through the      |
  | Internet. Several BITNET hosts also have Internet addresses.   |
  | Example: LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.BITNET can also be reached as        |
  | LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu . When dual addresses are given,        |
  | Internet users should use the Internet address, while BITNET   |
  | users should use the BITNET address.                           |
  |                                                                |
  | Note: In cases where a BITNET mailing list has dual addresses, |
  | we have usually given the Internet address. If you are on      |
  | BITNET, and using these addresses are difficult or impossible, |
  | ask your local postmaster for help.                            |

Computer viruses
----------------
Few online users ever live to see or experience a computer virus, 
but they do exist. So, read this: 
    A virus is a small, hidden computer program that can cause 
the loss or alteration of programs or data, and can  compromise 
their confidentiality. It can spread from program to program, and 
from system to system, without direct human intervention.                                           
               
    The chance of your computer being infected is small, but you're 
never safe. Therefore, download a program for virus detection and 
identification, like VIRUSSCAN from McAffee Associates, 4423 
Cheeney Street, Santa Clara, CA 95054-0253, U.S.A. They also have 
virus disinfection programs (for MS-DOS computers). 
    For more about viruses, subscribe to VIRUS-L@LEHIGH.EDU. 
CompuServe has the Mac New Users Forum (with a a Virus Clinic 
section), the McAfee Virus Help Forum, the Symantec AntiVirus 
Forum, and more. FidoNet has a VIRUS echo. ILINK has VIRUS-I. 
Usenet has bit.listserv.valert-l (Virus Alert List), and 
comp.virus . 

Online games
------------
If you're into games, why not investigate online adventure games? 
There are many alternatives. Prestel (England) offers TRASH, an 
environmental multi-user game with a futuristic theme and full of 
humor. Up to 64 persons can play simultaneously. 
    " ...Callers play out the role of pandimensional refuse 
disposal officers, whose primary aim in life is to clean up the 
multiverse, as the Trash environment is called." 
    "With a diverse range of 'psionic powers', which vary from 
the nasty (pyrokinesis) to the gentle (faith healing), at their 
command, Trash players roam across dimensions and universes, 
completing various tasks." 
    Bulletin boards throughout the world invite you to role playing 
games. Some have graphics, music and sound effects. Dungeons & 
Dragons is a popular choice. 
    On EXEC-PC, play Startrek. Select an identity and "play it out" 
according to its character. If you're a real afficionado, check out 
rec.arts.startrek.info on Usenet or the list RASI-L@ncc1701e.uucp 
(write LISTSERV@ncc1701e.uucp to subscribe). 
    Advanced players swap tricks on STARGAME@PCCVM.BITNET. On many 
BBSes, MUD is a most popular game. 

  | Multi-User Dungeons (MUD) is a structured and user-modifiable |
  | online environment, which allows users not only to interact   |
  | with each other, but to do role-playing, build and furnish    |
  | living areas and interaction areas, extend and create the     |
  | interactive "space" and the rules for using that space.       |

Popular choices on CompuServe are strategy games like The Island of 
Kesmai and Megawars. One game can last for weeks at a time. On CIX 
(England), many prefer the multi-user dungeon game DiscWorld. 
    If you prefer sport fantasies in the armchair, check out GEnie. 
They offer Rotisserie League Baseball. Decide what team player to 
be, and join in a match of American baseball. 
    Nintendo offers online games through the Famicom Networks in 
Japan and the U.S. Your PC must have a special graphics card to 
play games like GO and Shogi, a Japanese game of chess. 

Chat
----
Chat, or "keyboard talking," is a popular attraction, and in 
particular on the large online services. 
    Your first attempt will probably be a strange experience. 
When may people talk simultaneously in chat mode, incoherent 
sentences seem to fly over your computer screen. It takes some 
training to be able to read what each of them is saying. 
    CompuServe's Citizen Band Simulator (GO CB) is an electronic 
version of the hams' short-wave radio. It has 72 CB Simulator 
channels. You can chat with anonymous members, have fun and find 
new keypals. 
    On EXEC-PC's Chat and Entertainment System up to 64 users can 
talk simultaneously. GEnie calls their service Livewire CB. On BIX, 
look for CBIX. 
    Some users are serious about chatting. Several large companies 
are heavy users. Although this kind of talking is a slow process, 
it has advantages. It is easy to document the discussion. People 
from places geographically far apart can meet at a low cost to 
discuss. 
    Some online services charge less for chats than for other 
services. 

My hobby
--------
There are online forums for most hobbies: collection of stamps and 
coins, genealogy, music, holiday travels, skiing, purchase of 
consumer electronics, video, filming, and more. 
    Those you meet in the clubs share your interests. They come to 
exchange information and experiences, to listen, swap stamps or 
coins, participate in club auctions, and exploit favorable group 
discounts when buying things for their hobby. 
    In these clubs, the main attraction is the open messages that 
people write to each other. Many clubs also have libraries filled 
with special software (like data base programs for collectors) and 
information files. 
    Coins (on Coins@rocky.er.usgs.gov) is a forum for discussion of 
Numismatics, the study of coins, American and International.  Paper 
currency is also a welcome topic, but trading is not allowed. To 
subscribe, send a message to robert@whiplash.er.usgs.gov . 

Music
-----
ILINK, an international exchange of conferences between bulletin 
boards, has a forum for country music lovers. It presents itself 
in these words: 


     COUNTRY MUSIC
     Country & Western music including bluegrass and other related 
     forms.  Discussion of artists, techniques, instruments &
     musicians.  Host: John Stewart


     One oasis of civility in the BBS maelstrom is the 150-board 
     ILINK network -- recently renamed from InterLink.  Unlike most 
     BBS networks, ILINK carefully evaluates each board before 
     permitting membership.  "We are very selective -- some say 
     overly selective," says ILINK's international host Andy Keeves.  
     Choosiness keeps ILINK small but upholds the decorum of its 
     message bases. 

Usenet has rec.music.country.western . FidoNet has 60S_70S_PROGROCK 
about the progressive rock music of the 60's and 70's, gospel music 
in CHR_GSPL_MUSIC, a club for selling and buying between musicians 
(MUSICIAN'S_SERVICES), and (MUSIC_COMP_101) for aspiring composers. 
    CompuServe has a bunch of forums. Check out the Music/MIDI 
sections in the Amiga and Atari ST Arts forums. The latter is a 
full Music/MIDI forum. The Coin/Stamp/Collectibles Forum has a 
section for music collectors. 
    CompuServe's RockNet forum has the following structure:

       Available message sections:      Available file libraries: 
        0 General/Misc.                    0 General Misc
        1 Rock Music                       1 Rock Music
        2 Rock Radio                       2 Rock Radio
        3 Reviews/LK                       3 Reviews   
        4 Q&A/Help                         4 Q&A/Help
        5 Rock Film & Video                5 Rock Film & Video
        6 RockLetters                      6 RockLetters
        7 Trends                           7 Trends
        8 Heavy Metal                      8 Heavy Metal
        9 Old Wave                         9 Old Wave
       10 New Music                       10 New Music
       11 CD Hotline                      11 Compact Discs
       12 Green, Village                  12 Graphics/Programs

You can tailor your visits to RockNet to your personal interests. 
If you're into Heavy Metal, limit your readings of messages to 
those in section 8, and possibly 3 and 7. 
    The Music and Performing Arts Forum (GO MUSICARTS) is another 
interesting place on CompuServe. Converse with fellow music fans 
about on topics like classical, jazz/blues, Big Band, country/folk 
and religious music, ballet/dance, drama and more. 
    MIDI is discussed on several bulletin boards, including in 
conferences distributed by RelayNet.
    Classical music forums can be found on most larger services. 
Try CLASSM-L on LISTSERV@BROWNVM.BITNET. 
    For jazz, try the ILINK conference JAZZ, rec.music.bluenote on 
Usenet, MILES on LISTSERV@HEARN.NIC.SURFNET.NL (about Miles Davis), 
or BLUES-L at LISTSERV@BROWNVM.BROWN.EDU . 
    Another jazz oriented list, SATURN on LISTSERV@HEARN.BITNET, is 
for discussing the free-jazz big band leader, Sun Ra. 
    Network-Audio-Bits is an electronic magazine bringing reviews 
and information about rock, pop, new age, jazz, funk, folk music 
and other genres. (Write Murph@Maine.BITNET to join.) 
    The Music Newsletter offers reviews and interviews. Subscribe 
by email to LISTSERV@VM.MARIST.EDU using the command "SUBSCRIBE 
UPNEWS Your-full-name."  

  | On BITNET mailing lists, you subscribe by using the command  |
  | "SUB <mailing-list-name> Your-full-name" in the body of your |

  |                                                              |
  | There are also mailing lists on Unix workstations, PCs, and  |
  | microVaxen. These may require that you write the subscribe   |
  | command in full ('SUBSCRIBE'), or use other commands.        |

To get the "Music List of Lists," an overview of music oriented 
mailing lists, send email to mlol-request@wariat.org . 
    GRIND (write grind-request@unh.edu) focuses on discussions 
about grindcore/death metal/heavy thrash music. PRIMUS is about the 
funk/rock band Primus (write to primus-request@unh.edu). 
    KLARINET (on LISTSERV@VCCSCENT.BITNET) is a network bringing 
news, information, research and teaching items of interest, and 
other related information for clarinet players, teachers, students, 
and enthusiasts. 
    "Backstreets" on UUCP is for those who love the music of Bruce 
Springsteen (backstreets-request@virginia.edu). "Eclipse" (eclipse-
request@beach.cis.ufl.edu) focuses on Pink Floyd and his music. If 
a fan of Jimi Hendrix, join "hey-joe" (hey-joe-request@ms.uky.edu).

    "J-Pop" (jpop-request@wystan.bsd.uchicago.edu via UUCP) has 
discussions about Japanese pop/rock of today. 

Wine and food
-------------
Some people would rather fill their stomachs than their ears. They 
call CompuServe for the Cooks Online forum (for gourmets) and the 
Bacchus Wine Forum (for their throats). 
    BITNET has the mailing list "Eat" (EAT-L@VTVM2), a club for 
FoodLore/Recipe Exchange. In J-FOOD-L (J-FOOD-L@JPNKNU10 on BITNET) 
they discuss Japanese food and culture. 
    If your interest is more academic, subscribe to FOODWINE (on 
LISTSERV@CMUVM.CSV.CMICH.EDU). It is for those seriously interested 
in the academic study of food and its accompaniments in the 1990's, 
including a variety of disciplines, such as marketing, 
communications, hospitality, consumer affairs, hotel and catering 
management. 
    Usenet has rec.food.cooking, rec.food.recipes, rec.food.drink, 
rec.food.restaurants, and rec.food.veg for vegetarians. On FidoNet, 
check out INTERCOOK for words of wisdom on International Cooking. 
    On ILINK and RelayNet, look for CUISINE. That is where we found 
the following recipe for Mexican Meatloaf: 

        2 lb Ground Beef
        1 ea Bell Pepper, Diced
   10 1/2 oz Cream Chicken Soup
       10 oz Cheddar Cheese
        4 oz Green Chilies, Diced
        1 ea Onion, Chopped
        8 oz Taco Sauce
        1 pk Tortillas
        4 oz Mushrooms (fresh optional)
        2 ea Jalapen"'s (to taste)

  1. Brown ground beef and drain.
  2. Mix onions, green peppers, mushrooms, green CHILIES, taco 
     sauce, jalapen"'s and cream chicken soup into skillet with 
     ground beef. 
  3. Simmer until vegetables are soft.
  4. Shred cheddar cheese.
  5. In crock pot or dish, layer meat mixture, cheese, and 
     tortillas; heat until cheese melts.

Bon apetit!

    hints, experiences, equipment, techniques, and stereo
    "happenings."  Anyone interested is welcome to join.

There are clubs for all popular outdoor hobbies.

Roots
-----
On ROOTS-L@NDSUVM1.BITNET and soc.roots on Usenet, the emphasis is 
on genealogy. Here, you'll get tips about tools and techniques. You 
can exchange information about ancestors and find new friends and 
partners for joint research. 
    On CompuServe, it is called The Genealogy Forum. One message 
section is called Overseas Ancestry. Remember to check out the 
Family History Library, a newsletter bringing news from the library 
for genealogical research in Salt Lake City, U.S.A. (stored in 
Library 10.) 
    The North American bulletin boards ROOTS-BBS (San Francisco) 
and THE FAMILY ROOTS (Oklahoma) are connected to FidoNet. 
    GEnie has the Genealogy Knowledgebase. FidoNet has 

     GENDATA               Genealogy Database
     GENEALOGY:_WGW        Who's Got What (WGW) Data Base
     GENSOFT               Genealogy software
     SE_GENEALOGY          South Eastern US Genealogy Conference

Since FidoNet has links all over the world, these conferences can 
give contacts in countries that you might otherwise have problems 
in reaching. 
    On most of these services, you'll find interesting genealogy 
programs and files with practical hints about how to write a book 
about your family. 

Him and Her
-----------
Members of the female sex have their favorite meeting places, like 
Cleopatra on Bergen By Byte. Men do not have admission. 
    Usenet has soc.feminism. Those with limited access to Usenet, 
may subscribe to "feminism-digest." Send email to feminism-
digest@ncar.ucar.edu to get on the mailing list. 

    "Contact feminism-digest@ncar.ucar.edu" above means that you 
    need to write a message to this Internet email address with a 
    subscription request, or to receive further information about
    how to join. This mailing list does not have automatic
    subscriptions.

To join the mailing list "feminists," write Patricia Collins on 
collins@hplabs.hp.com . She presents the conference's purpose in 
this way: 

    The feminist mailing list is intended to provide a forum 
    for discussion of issues of interest to women, in a friendly
    atmosphere. The basic tenets of feminism and the day-to-day
    experiences of women do not have to be explained or defended.  
    Men and women can join, but everyone requesting to be added to 
    the mailing list MUST provide the moderator with: (1) a full 
    name; (2) a complete UUCP path to a well-known host or a fully 
    specified Internet address; (3) the correspondent's gender (for 
    records and statistics only).  NO exceptions.

While we're at it, let's move on to other topics associated with 
the term sex: 
    Bisexuals can participate in "sappho" on UUCP. Contact 
sappho-request@mc.lcs.mit.edu. On BITNET, you'll find BIFEM-L 
(BIFEM-L@BROWNVM), BISEXU-L (BISEXU-L@BROWNVM) and others.

    Usenet has tons of it: soc.motss, alt.politics.homosexuality, 
alt.sex.bestiality, alt.sex, alt.sex.bondage, alt.sex.pictures.d, 
clari.news.group.gays, alt.sex.pictures, alt.sex.motss,

    Conferences called "SEXUALITY" are alive on FidoNet and The 
Well. CompuServe has a Human Sexuality Adult Forum and a Human 
Sexuality Open Forum. STOPRAPE@BROWNVM.BITNET is a Sexual Assault 
Activist List. 
    Finally, there are a large number of pictures of nudes in all 
possible and impossible positions. Most of them are childish, some 
are decidedly pornographic, a few are beautiful and erotic. 
    The online services' policies vary about what kind of 
pictures and picture programs to make available. The larger the 
service, the more conservative they tend to be. 

Programs for hobbyists
----------------------
It's no rule that a service need to have a conference about a 
hobby, to have interesting programs available for downloading. 
Programs float around from service to service much easier than 
conference items. Still, the best programs for a given hobby are 
normally found on services where hobbyists meet to discuss. 
    You will find: 

    Chess and bridge programs,
    Morse code training programs for ham amateurs,
    Astrology programs,
    Data base systems for keeping track of music cassettes or
      records, video cassettes, books, stamps, coins, etc.
    Information systems for wine lovers,
    Recipe programs (tell me what you've got, and I'll tell
      you what you can make), and much more.

Online shopping
---------------
You can buy almost anything online: video cameras, books, music, 
Bonsai plants, golf equipment, canned cakes from Gimmee Jimmy's 
Cookies, Levi's trousers for men, computer equipment, a four-door 
Nissan Pathfinder SE-V6 car, and air tickets for Mexico. 
    Shoppers who let their modem do the "walking" are already a few 
steps ahead of people Still stuck shopping the old-fashioned way. 
Experienced online shoppers know that you can tap a world of stores 
without ever leaving your keyboard, and that you can browse and buy 
with very little effort. 
    Some services present their wares "for your information only." 
It's like reading newspaper ads. You must contact the seller to 
buy. Other services have large online supermarkets with many 
stores, and you can by while you visit. 
    Subscribers to CompuServe get a monthly magazine by mail. "Go 
Mall Shoppers' Guide" is a regular insert with color photos and 
descriptions of selected products. Type GO MALL, order a product,
enter your credit card number, and have it sent you by mail. 
    What if used goods are good enough? ILINK, the international 
conference exchange system, has GARAGESALE. Here you can buy and 
sell for hobby or home: Photo, video, audio, sound/music and midi 
equipment, and all kinds of other domestic items. ILINK also has 
a conference called BUY-SELL. 
    HAM-SALE on the FidoNet is for ham amateurs wanting to swap, by 
or sell. The American computer magazine PC Week is operating a 
Buyer's Forum on CompuServe. 
    UUCP's "muscle-cars" is where "muscle car" enthusiasts offer 
advice, share problems and solutions, discuss technical issues, 
racing, buying or selling parts, cars, or services, or just discuss 
cars and swap stories with others. (Contact: muscle-cars-
request@sorinc.PacBell.COM). 
    Similar experiences are waiting for you in "BMW" (Write: bmw-
request@sol.crd.ge.com), "british-cars" (Write: british-cars-

    Is this your first visit to Japan? Why not prepare your visit 
through the online service TWICS in Tokyo. It presents itself like 
this: 

  "Japan is an island nation, full of communities in villages, 
  towns, and cities squeezed in between the mountains and the sea, 
  with ports of various sizes and shapes through which communication 
  flows between communities. 

  Our own online community is organized in the same terms, an 
  island community "BEEJIMA" (Bee Island), with our village 
  ("MURA"), a port ("MINATO"), and our very own volcanic mountain 
  ("YAMA"). 

  In the village, there is a village office ("YAKUBA"), a community 
  meeting place ("YORIAI"), a high-tech corner ("AKIHABARA") named 
  after the famous electronics district in Tokyo, a health center 
  ("EMEDICA"), a place to hang around and read things ("HON YA"), a 
  school ("GAKKOU"), and a market ("ICHIBA"). The port has holding 
  areas and leads to other parts of Japan ("NIPPON") and the world 
  ("SEKAI").  The mountain has a hot springs ("ONSEN") recreational 
  area, and a lively outdoor bath ("IN THE OFURO") which has become 
  the social center of our island.

Example: KIDLINK
----------------
Many parents and teachers regard the online world as a learning 
opportunity for their kids. Some of them turn to KIDLINK, a global 
service for children between 10 - 15 years of age. The service is 
operated by a grassroots network of volunteers. 
    The objective is to get as many children as possible involved 
in a global dialog. 
    Participation is free. Before joining the discussion, however, 
each child must respond to the following four questions: 

    1. Who am I?
    2. What do I want to be when I grow up?
    3. How do I want the world to be better when I grow up?
    4. What can I do Now to make this come true?

The kids can write in any language. Most answers are sent through 
the Internet to a large online database in North America. Anyone 
with an email connection to the Internet can search this database 
at will. 
    When they have submitted their responses, they are invited to
'meet' the others in several KIDCAFEs. The cafes are split up by 
language. Here, they can discuss anything from pop music to how it 
is to live in other countries. 
    KIDLINK grew from an idea in 1990 to over 10,000 participating 
children in 50 countries by May 1993. 
    Schools all over the globe are integrating KIDLINK with their 
classes in languages, geography, history, environment, art, etc. 
To the kid participant, KIDCAFE may be the beginning of a personal 
network of international friends.

Your personal network
---------------------
Network is a word with many meanings. It can be a system set up to 
transport data from one computer to another. It can be an online 
service with many conferences, and a friendly connection between 
people (like in "old boys' network"). Here, we use it in the latter 
meaning of the word. 
    We use our personal networks more than most of us think of. 
We have a chain of people that we call on to ask for advice, help, 
and who we invite to participate in projects or parties. When they 
ask us for assistance, we lend a hand. 
    The online world has some interesting characteristics. One is 
that most participants in online conferences already have received 
so much help from others that they feel obliged to pay back. They 
do this by helping others. 
    Those who help, know that helping others will be rewarded. The 
reward, however, may not come directly from the persons that they 
help. They contributions help maintain and develop the online world 
as one giant personal network. 
    A typical example: I wanted to buy a 425 megabyte hard disk for 
my Toshiba 5100 personal computer. I discover the existence of such 
a drive, when a user told about his experiences in CompuServe's 
Toshiba Forum. Before placing an order, I wrote to check if he was 
still satisfied with the disk. 
    The happy user did more than reply. He told about other sellers 
and offered to help out with return shipment of my computer when 
done. He made it clear that he had no financial interest in the 
companies selling the upgrade. We had no previous contact with 
each other. 
    The online world is full of similar examples. The list of what 
people do to help others is very, very long. 
    In most conferences and forums you get help, just like that.
There is always someone prepared to help.
    Still, the best long range strategy to build chances of getting 
help when you need it, is to be visually present in conferences, 
that matter to you. 'Being visually present' means that you should 
contribute in the discussions and help others as much as you can. 
The   p o s i t i v e    contributors get a lot of friends and a 
disproportional amount of help from others. 
    That is all it takes to build a personal network. One day you 
may need it. It will give you an incredible advantage. I have seen 
people get jobs, partners and clients through such contacts. The 
online world is full of opportunities. 

Watch your words
----------------
Written communications are deprived of the body language and tone 
of voice that convey so much in face-to-face meetings and even in 
telephone conversations. Therefore, it makes sense to work much 
harder to build in humor, sarcasm, or disagreement and avoid your 
words come across as stupidity, rudeness, or aggressiveness. 
    One way of defusing misunderstanding is to include cues as to 
your emotional state. One popular technique is to use keyboard 
symbols like :-). We call these symbols emoticons.
    What :-) means? Tilt your head to the left and look again. Yes, 
it's a smiling face. 
    Here are some other examples to challenge your imagination: ;-) 
(Winking Smiley), :-( (Sad), 8-) (User wears glasses), :-o (Shocked 
or surprised), and :-> (Hey hey). 
    A bracketed <g> is shorthand for grin, and <g,d&r> means 
grinning, ducking, and running. Some people prefer to write their 
emotional state in full text, like in these two examples: *grin* 
and *smile*.
    Do not misunderstand. You still should not allow yourself to 
write the most appallingly insulting things to other people, and 
then try to shrug it off with a <smile>. 
    Watch your words. They are so easy to store on a hard disk. 

Religion and philosophy
-----------------------
CompuServe's Religion Forum (GO RELIGION) has many message sections 
with associated file libraries. You can get into serious discussion 
about topics ranging from Christianity, Judaism, Eastern Religions, 
Islam, Interfaith Dialog, Limbo, Pagan/Occult, to Religion and 
Science, Liturgical Churches, Mormonism, Ethics and Values, and 
more. You may also want to check out the New Age Forum. 
    Usenet's offerings include these: 

  soc.culture.jewish      Jewish culture & religion. 
  soc.religion.christian  Christianity and related topics. 
  soc.religion.eastern    Discussions of Eastern religions.
  soc.religion.islam      Discussions of the Islamic faith.
  talk.religion.misc      Religious, ethical, & moral implications.
  talk.religion.newage    Esoteric and minority religions & 
                          philosophies.
  alt.pagan               Discussions about paganism & religion.
  alt.religion.computers  People who believe computing is 
                          "real life."
  clari.news.religion     Religion, religious leaders, 
                          televangelists.

The BITNET/Internet arena has The Islamic Information & News Net on 
MUSLIMS (available through LISTSERV@ASUVM.INRE.ASU.EDU). ISLAM-L 
(on LISTSERV@ULKYVM.LOUISVILLE.EDU) is a non-sectarian forum for 
discussion, debate, and the exchange of information by students and 
scholars of the history of Islam. 
    BUDDHA-L (on LISTSERV@ULKYVM.LOUISVILLE.EDU) provides a means 
for those interested in Buddhist Studies to exchange information 
and views.  BUDDHIST (on LISTSERV@JPNTUVM0.BITNET) is for non-
academic discussions.
    BAPTIST (LISTSERV@UKCC.UKY.EDU) is the Open Baptist Discussion 
List. THEOLOGY (contact U16481%UICVM.BITNET@VM1.NODAK.EDU) is a 
mailing list dedicated to the intellectual discussion of religion. 
In its self-presentation, it says: 

    Intellectual is stressed as opposed to the "personal," the 
    inspirational, or evangelistic.  This does not mean one cannot 
    evangelize, but rather that participants should persuade rather 
    than brow-beat or attack those they disagree with.  Arguments 
    are inevitable, but they ultimately should resolve into mutual 
    understanding or at least a truce. 

Pagan (Contact: pagan-request@drycas.club.cc.cmu.edu) is set up 
to discuss the religions and philosophies of paganism. BELIEF-L (on 
LISTSERV@BROWNVM.BITNET) is designed to be a forum where personal 
ideologies can be discussed, examined, and analyzed.  
    The discussion list PHILCOMM@RPIECS.BITNET is where you debate 
the philosophy of communication. PHILOSOP@YORKVM1.BITNET is the 
Philosophy Discussion Forum. 
    Several sacred texts and primary texts of religious interest 
are available by anonymous FTP or LISTSERV. The Bible, the Book of 
Mormon and the Koran (also spelled Quran) are available at many 
sites and in a variety of file formats. 
    The Bible (King James Version) is available as bible10.zip and 
bible10.txt via FTP to mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu (128.174.201.12) in the 
/extext/etext92/ directory. 
    M.H. Shakir's translation of the Koran is available as 114 
individual ASCII text chapters via FTP to quake.think.com 
(192.31.181.1) in the /pub/etext/koran/ directory. 
    A short file containing quotes from the Koran is available via 
LISTSERV from LISTSERV@asuacad as PAKISTAN AL_QURAN. 
    A collection of Sanskrit texts is available via FTP to 
ftp.bcc.ac.uk in the /pub/users/ucgadkw/indology/ directory. 
    You may use the Archie service (see Appendix 4) to find other 
religious texts that are also available through the Internet. On 
FidoNet, check out JVArcServ.

Job-hunting by modem 
--------------------
Unemployment is a global problem, and losing a job is often a bad 
experience. If this ever should happen to you, consider checking 
out the BITNET discussion list LAIDOFF@ARIZVM1 - "So, you've been 
laidoff?" 
    Maybe you already have a job, but are constantly searching for 
something better. 
    There are many forums and conferences devoted to help you get a 
new job. FidoNet has the JOBS conference, for those not in a hurry, 
and JOBS-NOW (Job & Employment offerings/listings) for those who 
have no more time to wait. 
    On Bergen By Byte, it is called 'Job_market', and on ILINK 
CAREER. In many countries there are local bulletin boards operated 
by public employment agencies.
    On Televerket's Datatorg (Norway), you can browse jobs from the 
following menu (translated):

If your potential employers have an email address, you can send 
dozens of job resumes - while going for a cup of coffee! 
    WORK-AT-HOME on FidoNet is for those planning to start their 
own business ("Take this job and shove it! I'll work at home!") 
    CompuServe has the Working-From-Home Forum under the sysopship 
of online gurus Paul and Sarah Edwards. Its file library contains 
back issues of the electronic magazine "Making It on Your Own." 
GEnie has the Home Office Small Business forum (HOSB). 
    Home based business opportunities may exist within areas such 
as desktop publishing, desktop video, high-tech equipment repair, 
import and export management, and professional practice management. 
Learn from others in forums or conferences on related topics. 
    The good news is that many organizations are having problems 
finding qualified candidates for their vacant positions, and that 
some of them are turning to The Online World for help. One of them 
did it like this (from an online announcement): 

        Because it is difficult to locate qualified candidates for 
   positions in special libraries and information centers, and to 
   assist special librarians and information specialists to locate 
   positions, the student chapter of the Special Libraries 
   Association at Indiana University has formed a LISTSERV, SLAJOB, 
   in connection with the Indiana Center for Database Systems. 
        The LISTSERV, which is available on both the Internet and 
   Bitnet, will help special libraries and information centers in 
   the sciences, industry, the arts and within public and academic 
   libraries to have a central location for announcing special 
   library and information science positions. 
        The LISTSERV is available to individuals or organizations 
   that have an Internet or Bitnet network connection.  For those 
   on the network, subscribe by sending an email message to: 

   "LISTSERV@iubvm.bitnet" or "LISTSERV@iubvm.ucs.indiana.edu". 
   Leave the subject line blank and then type the following in the 
   message of the text: 

   subscribe SLAJOB [firstname]  [lastname]

The Israelis have the mailing list CJI, Computer Jobs in Israel. 
Send mail to LISTSERV@JERUSALEM1.DATASRV.CO.IL with the usual "SUB 
CJI Your-Full-Name" in the text of your message. This will give you 
monthly updated lists of open computer jobs. 
   When you get tired of hunting for a job, why not relax with 
HUMOR at LISTSERV@UGA.CC.UGA.EDU. This mailing list distributes 
humor of all types, topics and tastes.  To subscribe, send the 
following command to the LISTSERV: 

   SUB HUMOR [firstname]  [lastname]


Chapter 6: Your personal HealthNet
==================================

Health is a concern in most families. Where a family member or a
friend is suffering from cancer, AIDS, a serious disability, or a 
rare disease, finding help is imperative. 
    Fortunately, there are many sources of information for those 
who want to know more. There are clubs and forums, where you can 
meet others with the same disease or problem. They are open 24 
hours a day. Those who cannot sleep at night, can log in any time 
to "talk" with others. 
    The social aspect of joining a club is important. However, it 
may be equally important to learn from other people's experiences 
with alternative treatment methods, doctors, medicines, and to get 
practical medical advice. 
    Here are some examples to illustrate the width of the offering:

AIDS
----
You may start with "The Fog City Online Information Service" in San 
Francisco, the world's largest bulletin board of AIDS information. 
The cost of using this BBS from afar may be reduced considerably by 
using i-Com or similar data transport services (see chapter 13). 
    CompuServe has a Human Sexuality Forum and a MEDSig with 
associated file libraries. It also has a surcharged ZiffNet 
database with full-text articles about health topics (Health 
Database Plus). On the Well, enter "g aids". 
    NewsNet has the newsletters "AIDS Weekly" and "AIDS Therapies." 
The latter is a directory, updated monthly, with descriptions of 
standard and experimental treatments for AIDS, along with a guide 
to treatments for the opportunistic infections (OI) of AIDS. It 
incorporates all existing and potential new AIDS treatments in one 
place.
    On BITNET, check out "AIDS/HIV News" (AIDSNEWS@EB0UB011) and 
the mailing list on AIDS@EB0UB011. 
    Usenet has sci.med.aids (AIDS: treatment, pathology/biology of 
HIV, prevention), bionet.molbio.hiv, clari.tw.health.aids (AIDS 
stories, research, political issues), and bit.listserv.aidsnews. 
    If you do not have access to Usenet, send a message to aids-
request@cs.ucla.edu for articles from AIDSNEWS, statistics and news 
summaries. 
    Aids-stat-request@wubios.wustl.edu is another source of current 
AIDS statistics. Send a request to info-aids@rainbow.UUCP. It is  a 
clearinghouse of information, and discussion about alternative 
treatment methods, political implications, and more. 

Example: Kidney disease
-----------------------
In chapter 1, I told you that my wife has a rare disease called 
Polycystic Kidneys. Here are more details about what happened 
during the "online health trip" to CompuServe with her doctor: 

The command "GO HEALTH" gave the following menu:

    1 HealthNet
    2 Human Sexuality
    3 Consumer Health
    4 NORD Services/Rare Disease
       Database
    5 PaperChase (MEDLINE)
    6 Information USA/Health
    7 Handicapped User's Database
    8 Disabilities Forum
    9 Aids Information
   10 Cancer Forum

Another menu, which listed available "PROFESSIONAL FORUMS," had 
choices like AAMSI Medical Forum and Health Forum. Besides visiting
these, we searched several medical databases. 
    Menu selection five gave us The National Library of Medicine's 
database (MEDLINE), which is full of references to biomedical 
literature. This database had more than five million references to 
articles from 4.000 magazines from 1966 and up to date, when we 
searched it in 1991. It increases by some 25.000 new references per 
month. Easy navigation by menus. Easy to search. 
    The AAMSI Medical Forum (MedSIG) is sponsored by The American 
Association for Medical Systems and Informatics (AAMSI). It is a 
forum for professionals within health care, people within associated 
technical fields, and ordinary CompuServe users. The members meet 
to find, develop and swap information. 
    MedSIG has a library full of programs and information files. 
This is an example of what you can find there: 

    ATLAS.ARC          21-Sep-88 30161              

    Keywords: STEREOTAXIC STEREOTACTIC STEREOTAXIS ATLAS THALAMOTOMY 
    MAP FUNCTIONAL GIF
    
    This contains several of the most useful stereotaxic maps from 
    the Schaltenbrand and Wahren Atlas in GIF format.  If you can 
    get GIF into your CAD or drawing program, you can scale the maps 
    to fit your individualized patient's AC-PC distance, thereby 
    generating a customized map for your patient.
    
CompuServe has many programs for reading GIF files, and converting 
GIF files to other graphical formats. 
    Through IQuest, we searched medical databases. Simple menus 
helped define relevant search terms. When done, IQuest searched 
selected databases for us, and presented the finds on our local 
computer screen. 
    The basic rate for completing the search was US$9.00. In 
addition, we paid the normal fees for using CompuServe. From 
Norway, this amounted to around US$ 40/hour at 2400 bps when 
logging on through the local Infonet node at that time. Today, it 
costs less.
    This gave us up to 10 article headlines, when searching in 
bibliographic databases. Abstracts of selected articles were 
displayed on our screen for an additional US$2.00. 
    We used the search mode "SmartScan" in the area "Medical 
research." IQuest searched several databases with a minimum of 
manual intervention. 
    First, it told us that the following databases would be 
included in the search: 

BRS databases:
  Ageline - Contains  references to and abstracts of materials on 
    aging and the elderly.  Covers psychological, medical, economic, 
    and political concerns.
  AIDS Database -  Includes critically selected articles covering 
    all aspects of AIDS, (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), and
    AIDS-related research.
  AIDS Knowledge Base - Provides an online textbook of the most 
    current information on AIDS available from San Francisco General  
    Hospital. 
  Combined Health Information Database  -  For professionals, 
    patients, and the general public, CHID contains references to a 
    variety of materials on arthritis, diabetes, health education,  
    digestive diseases, and high blood pressure. Provides abstracts.
  Embase - Includes extensive abstracts of articles related to 
    biomedicine from medical journals worldwide. About 40% of the 
    references are online only. 
  Rehabdata  -  Covers articles, books, reports, and audiovisual 
    materials dealing with the rehabilitation of the physically and  
    mentally handicapped.  References only.
  Sport Database - Indexes publications dealing with sports, 
    including training, medicine, education, and history. Drawn 
    mostly from English and French with technical articles from 
    other languages. 

Dialog databases:
  BioBusiness - Deals with the business aspects of biotechnology and 
    biomedical research. Draws from BIOSIS and MANAGEMENT CONTENTS.
  BIOSIS    Previews  -  Provides international coverage of all 
    aspects of biological science. 
  Cancerlit  - Monitors articles from journals and other technical 
    publications dealing with all aspects of cancer research 
    throughout the world.  Includes abstracts.
  Clinical Abstracts - Covers human clinical study articles of major 
    importance selected from leading medical journals. Includes all 
    aspects of clinical medicine.  Corresponds to Abstracts in 
    Internal Medicine. Abstracts available.
  Life Sciences Collection - Abstracts technical literature in the 
    life sciences from journals and other scientific publications 
    worldwide. 
  Medline (1966 - to date)  - Indexes articles from medical journals 
    published worldwide. Corresponds to Index Medicus, International 
    Nursing Index and Index to Dental Literature. Includes abstracts 
    in roughly 40% of the records.
  SciSearch  -  Monitors worldwide literature across a wide range of 
    scientific and technological disciplines.  Produced by the 
    Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). 

Then we entered our search term: "LIVER AND CYST/". The search word 
"CYST/" signified that "cyst" should match any words starting with 
these four characters. 
   While searching, IQuest gave the following progress report:

  Scanning BRS databases.

  Accessing Network...........Completed.
  Accessing Database Host.....Completed.
  Logging on..................Completed.
  Logging on (second step)....Completed.
  Selecting Databases.........Completed.

  Each period equals one line
  of scanned data.  This may take
  several minutes................................

It continued in the same way with a "Scanning Dialog databases." 
    When the search results were presented, we glanced quickly at 
the article abstracts, ordered two articles to be sent us by mail 
and typed BYE. 
    CompuServe reported "Off at 09:12 EST 17-Nov-88 Connect time = 
0:35." The two articles arrived Norway by mail a few weeks later. 
    The whole trip, including visits in medical forums, took 35 
minutes. The cost, including local telephone and network charges, 
was US$95. Of this total cost, the extra cost of searching through 
IQuest amounted to US$54.00. We all felt that the costs were well 
justified. 

  | A note about the costs: The online tour was done manually,  |
  | using full menus. We discussed our search strategy while    |
  | connected, which is more expensive than logging off to plan |
  | the next moves. Also, note that the extra cost of searching |
  | IQuest ($54) was not time dependent.                        |

Right now? I have promised to donate one kidney to my wife when the 
time comes. This has prompted me (1993) to join a mailing list for 
"Organ transplant recipients and anyone else interested in the 
issues" (TRNSPLNT@WUVMD.BITNET). 

Cancer
------
FidoNet has the forum CARCINOMA (Cancer Survivors). BITNET has the 
discussion lists CANCER-L@WVNVM and CLAN (Cancer Liaison and Action 
Network on CLAN@FRMOP11). CompuServe has a Cancer Forum. NewsNet 
offers the newsletter CANCER RESEARCHER WEEKLY. 
    In September 1992, the following message was posted on CANCER-
L by a member from Brazil: 

  "A close friend was just diagnosed with acute leukemia of a type 
  called calapositive pre-B linphoplastic. It is supposedly an 
  early diagnosis since he is not anemic. We are very shocked but 
  he is reacting quite bravely and all he wants is to have access 
  to literature on his condition. Are there any new genetic 
  engineering developments effectively clinically available? What 
  is the present state of knowledge regarding this specific form of 
  leukemia? 

  He was diagnosed three hours ago, is 48 yrs old, and will start 
  chemotherapy tomorrow. He was informed that chemotherapy is quite 
  effective in this type of leukemia. But we wonder if there isn't 
  a possibility to use gene therapy. 

  Any help will be greatly appreciated. - Dora."

There were several helpful replies. This came from a member in the 
United States: 

  "In response to the request for information on treatment for 
  leukemia, I recommend that you access CancerNet, the National 
  Cancer Institute's mail server on the Internet which provides 
  current information on treatment for leukemia. To request the 
  Contents List and Instructions, send a mail message to 

   cancernet@icicb.nci.nih.gov (Internet address)
   cancernet%icicb.nci.nih.gov@nihcu ( BITNET)

  Leave the subject line blank, and in the body of the mail 
  message, enter "HELP".  When you receive the Contents list, 
  request the statement for Adult Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia 
  (cn-101024). 

  There are also News and General Information items, under the 
  Heading PDQ Database Information in the Contents List which 
  provide information on centers which have access to Physician 
  Data Query, NCI's database of cancer treatment information which 
  includes clinical trials information for leukemia. - Cheryl."

CancerNet is the U.S. National Cancer Institute's international 
information center. It is a quick and easy way to obtain, through 
electronic mail, recommended treatment guidelines from the National 
Cancer Institute's Physician Data Query system.  
    To access CancerNet, send email to:

    cancernet@icicb.nci.nih.gov

Leave the subject line blank. In the body of the mail message, enter 
HELP to receive instructions and the current contents list. 
    The National Cancer Center in Tokyo Japan has a gopher service 
at gopher.ncc.go.jp. The World Health Organization (WHO) has one at 
gopher.who.ch.

Disabilities
------------
Bulletin boards and online conferences give equal access to all
persons. Everybody is treated the same way, regardless if they sit 
in a wheel chair, have a hearing impairment, stutter, cannot speak 
clearly, have difficulties in thinking or acting quickly, or just 
have a different looks. 
    You need not worry about typing errors. Those who read them 
will never know whether it's because you never learned how to write 
on a computer, or if it is because you have difficulties in 
controlling your movements. 
    You alone decide if others are to know about your personal 
disability. If you want it to be a secret, then it will remain a 
secret. 
    Nobody can possibly know that you are mute and lame from the 
neck and down, that computer communication is your main gate into 
the outer world, and that you are writing messages with a stick 
attached to your forehead. Therefore, the online world has changed 
the lives of many people with disabilities. 
    Computer communications have opened a new world for those who 
are forced to stay at home, or thinks that it is too difficult to 
travel. Those who can easily drive their car to the library, often 
have difficulties in understanding the significance of this. 
    Usenet has alt.education.disabled and misc.handicap. It covers 
all areas of disabilities, technical, medical, educational, legal, 
etc. UUCP has handicap. It is presented in the following words: 

    Contact: wtm@bunker.shel.isc-br.com
    Purpose:  The Handicap Digest provides an information/discussion
    exchange for issues dealing with the physically/mentally
    handicapped.  Topics include, but are not limited to: medical,
    education, legal, technological aids and the handicapped in
    society.

CompuServe's Disabilities Forum has the following sections: General 
Interest, Develop. Disabilities, Emotional Disturbances, Hearing 
Impairments, Learning Disabilities, Vision Impairments, Mobility 
Impaired, Rights/Legislation, Education/Employment and Family 
Life/Leisure. 
    AUTISM@SJUVM.BITNET is devoted to the developmentally disabled, 
their teachers, and those interested in this area. The list BLIND-
L@UAFSYSB.BITNET focuses on "Computer Use by and for the Blind." 
COMMDIS@RPIECS.BITNET is a mailing list discussing "Speech 
disorders." 
    DEAF-L@SIUCVMB.BITNET is the "Deaf Discussion List," and 
DEAFBLND@UKCC.UKY.EDU the "Deaf-Blind Discussion List." STUT-HLP 
(LISTSERV@BGU.EDU) is a support forum for people who stutter and 
their families.
    On L-HCAP@NDSUVM1.BITNET, the focus is on Technology for the 
handicapped. BACKS-L@UVMVM.BITNET discusses research on low back 
pain disability. 
    The Handicap Digest is an electronic mail only digest of 
articles relating to all types of issues affecting the handicapped. 
The articles are taken from the Usenet newsgroup, the Handicap 
News. (misc.handicap) and various FidoNet conferences such as 
ABLED, BlinkTalk  SilentTalk, Chronic Pain, Spinal Injury, Rare 
Conditions, and several others. Subscribe by email to

    wtm@bunker.shel.isc-br.com

Handicap.shel.isc-br.com (129.189.4.184) is the email address to an 
anonymous ftp site that has disability-related files and programs.  
The disk has some 40 directories with 500 or so files covering all 
types of disabilities. (This service can be used through FTPMail. 
See chapter 12 about how to do this.) 

Getting old
-----------
BITNET has the "BIOSCI Ageing Bulletin Board" on AGEING@IRLEARN . 
Usenet has bionet.molbio.ageing, while CompuServe's Issues Forum 
has a message section called "Seniors." 
    Ageline on Dialog is a database produced by the American 
Association of Retired Persons. It does an excellent job covering 
research about older persons, particularly on consumer issues and 
health care, by summarizing journal articles and the contents of 
other published reports. 
    While our "face-to-face" world sometimes makes it difficult for 
older people to participate in discussions between young people, 
this is not so in the Online World. All people are treated the same 
way. It is impossible for others to know your age, unless someone 
tells them. 

Holistic Healing and Health
---------------------------
HOLISTIC on LISTSERV@SIUCVMB.SIU.EDU is dedicated to "providing 
information and discussion on holistic concepts and methods of 
living which provide a natural way of dealing with the challenges 
of life." Here are some topics dealt with in this forum: 

      Various Dimensions of Holistic Healing and Health
      States of Consciousness
      Meditation and the role it plays in spiritual/physical health 
      The impact of a healthy diet - including Herbs and Vitamins
      Bodywork - such as Rolfing, Trager bodywork, Reichian, etc.
      Acupuncture/pressure
      Hypnosis and Biofeedback
      Visualizations and Affirmations
      Spiritual Healing - Psychic healing methods
      Bioenergetics
      The holistic connection between mind and body
      Honest discussion of topics relevant to personal/spiritual 
      growth - And anything else within context for the betterment 
      of the world. 

The following message is typical:

From:    Helen 
Subject: Re: Asthma and Sinus Problems
To:      Multiple recipients of list HOLISTIC 

  My condolences to fellow people allergic to cats.  Cats and 
  strawberries are two of the most allergenic substances.  
  Behavorial changes have proven to be EVERYTHING to me.  The 
  techniques I've employed have helped many others.  First, try 
  sleeping at a 45 degree angle.  This usually requires piling up 
  pillows. The elevation of the head facilitates drainage from the 
  sinuses.  When the situation gets really bad, I've slept sitting 
  up on a couch or arm chair propped up by numerous pillows and 
  cushions.  This technique can take some getting used to, but, it 
  works like a charm and is kinder to your system than drug 
  therapy. 
    Second, try "ephedra" tea.  This is an herb found in Chinese 
  herb shops.  Ask the herbalist how to prepare it. 
    I highly recommend the book "Natural Health, Natural Medicine" 
  by Andrew Weil, M.D. of U of A Med School in Tucson. See pages 
  253-256 for more information on asthma. 
     Fourth, stay hydrated.  This means not only drinking PLENTY of 
  fluids, but humidifying the house (that is if you're not also 
  allergic to molds). 
     Basic behavorial techniques are important....diet, exercise, 
  etc. etc, ...but this is the holistic network...I'm preaching to 
  the choir... 

     Finally, take heart!  Being allergic to cats is not well 
  received by cat lovers...often we're cat lovers ourselves. 
  Depending on the breed of cat, there is a good chance you will 
  eventually habituate to those you are around over the long term.  
  Good luck, the advice about sleeping with your head significantly 
  elevated is the best I have ever given out to fellow sinus 
  problem sufferers. It really works!!

Chapter 7: Electronic mail, telex, and fax
==========================================

Electronic mail is one of the most popular online services. People 
living thousands of miles apart can exchange messages and documents 
very quickly. 
    International Resource Development, Inc., an American research 
organization, claimed (1992) that we can send electronic mail to 
more than 10 million personal mailboxes. We believe the figure to 
be much higher. The Matrix News (Texas, U.S.A.) claims the number 
is over 18 million (March 1993). 
    The Boardwatch Magazine (U.S.A.) believes that new callers are 
coming online for their first time at a rate of close to 10,000 per 
day (January 1993). 
    Electronic Mail & Micro Systems (New Canaan, Conn., U.S.A.) 
estimated an average of 27.8 million messages sent per month in 
1990. Mail through the Internet and grassroots services on free 
bulletin boards (like FidoNet) is not included in their figure. 
    The annual rate of increase in the number of messages is over 
30% and increasing. 
    If a given email service charges you US$30 per hour, it will 
cost you a meager US$0.075 to send one typewritten letter (size A-
4, or around 2,200 characters). See chapter 15 for a breakdown of 
this cost. 
    If you live in Norway, and send the letter by ordinary mail to 
a recipient in Norway, postage alone is US$0.53 (1992). The cost is 
seven times higher than using email. 
    To send the same letter from Norway to the United States by 
ordinary mail will cost 11 times more. This letter takes several 
days to reach the destination, while email messages arrive almost 
instantly. 
    Often, you can send email messages to several recipients in one 
operation - without paying extra for the pleasure. Compare this to 
sending to several parties by fax!
    You do not have to buy envelopes and stamps, fold the sheet, 
put it into the envelope, and bring it to a mailbox. Just let the 
computer call your favorite email service to send the letter. 
    The recipient does not have to sit by the computer waiting for 
your mail. Upon receipt, it will be automatically stored in his 
mailbox. He can read it when he has time. 
    The recipient can print it locally, and it will be a perfect 
document, no different to one typed in locally. He can also make 
corrections or comments, and email onwards to a third party. In 
this way several people can work jointly on a report, and no time 
is it re-typed from scratch.
    When you receive several messages in the morning, you can very 
quickly create replies to them one at the time at your keyboard, 
and then send them in one go. No need to feed five different pieces 
of paper into a fax machine or envelopes for five different people.
    Where you can find a telephone, you can also read mail. In most 
countries, communicating through email is easy and economical. 
    By the way, the simple but miraculous thing about email is that 
you can quote easily and exactly the point to which you are 
replying. This is a revolution in communication, no?

How to send email?
-------------------
This is what it normally takes for a CompuServe user to send me
a message: 

    Type GO MAIL to get to the "post office," and then type 
    COMPOSE. 
         "Start writing," says CompuServe. Type your message
    manually, or send a file (text or binary). Type /EXIT when 
    done. 
         "To whom?" asks CompuServe. You enter: "Odd de Presno
    75755,1327," or just my mailbox number (75755,1327).
         CompuServe asks you to enter Subject. You type: "Hello,
    my friend!" Your message has been sent. 
         A few seconds later, the message will arrive in my 
    mailbox. If I am online to CompuServe at the moment, I will 
    probably read it right away. If not, it will stay there until I 
    get around to fetch it. 

Above, we used the term "normally takes to send." Please note that  
many users never ever TYPE these commands! They use various types 
of automatic software to handle the mechanics of sending and 
receiving mail (see Chapter 16). 
    Other systems require different commands to send email. Ulrik 
at the University of Oslo (Norway) is a Unix system. So is The Well 
in San Francisco. On such systems, mail is normally sent using 
these commands: 

    Type "mail opresno@extern.uio.no". When the computer asks for 
    "Subject:," enter "Hello, my friend!" 
         Type your message or send it. When done, enter a period 
    (.) in the beginning of a line. Ulrik will reply with "Cc:" to 
    allow you to 'carbon copy' the message to other people. If you 
    don't want that, press ENTER and the message is on its way.
         While I wrote this book, I had to go to Japan. A simple 
    command allowed me to redirect all incoming mail to CompuServe. 
    As a result I could read and send mail by calling a local 
    CompuServe number in several Japanese cities. 

Though the commands for sending email differ between systems, the 
principle is the same. All systems will ask you for an address and 
the text of your message. On some, the address is a code, on others 
a name (like ODD DE PRESNO). 
    Most systems will ask for a Subject title. Many will allow you 
to send copies of the message to other recipients (Cc:). 
    Some services allow you to send binary files as email. Binary 
files contain codes based on the binary numeration system. Such 
codes are used in computer programs, graphics pictures, compressed 
spreadsheets and text files, and sound files. 
    Many online services let you send messages as fax (to over 15 
million fax machines), telex (to over 1.8 million telex machines), 
and as ordinary paper mail. We have tested this successfully on 
CompuServe, MCI Mail and other services. 
    On CompuServe, replace "Odd de Presno 75755,1327" with ">FAX:  
4737027111". My fax number is +47 370 27111. 
    On MCI Mail type "CREATE:". MCI asks for "To:," and you type 
"Odd de Presno (Fax)". MCI asks for "Country:". You enter "Norway". 
By "RECIPIENT FAX NO" enter "37027111" (the code for international 
calls). The country code for Norway, 01147, is added automatically. 
By "Options?," press ENTER. When MCI Mail asks for more recipients, 
press ENTER. Type your message and have it sent. 
    To send a telex, you'll need the recipient's telex number, an 
answerback code, and the code of the recipient's country. If the 
message is meant for telex number 871161147, answerback ZETO, and 
country Russia (country code SU), enter ">TLX:871161147 ZETO SU" 
when sending from CompuServe. 
    By entering ">POSTAL", CompuServe will send your mail to a 
business associate in California or Brazil as a professional laser-
printed letter. It will take you through the process of filling out 
the various address lines. The letter may well arrive faster than 
through ordinary mail. 

When the recipient is using another mailbox system
--------------------------------------------------
When the recipient is using your mailbox service, writing addresses 
is simple. Not so when your email has to be forwarded to mailboxes 
on other online services. 
    The inter-system email address consists of a user name, a 
mailbox system code, and sometimes also routing information. The 
problem is that there is no universal addressing format. Finding 
out how to write a given address may be surprisingly difficult. 
    Some services are not set up for exchange of email with other 
services. This is the case with my bulletin board, the Saltrod 
Horror Show. To send mail to a user of this system, you'll have to 
call it directly and enter it there. This bulletin board is not 
connected to the outside world for exchange of mail. 
    If your favorite system lets you send mail to other services, 
make a note about the following:

    * You need to know the exact address of your recipient, and
      whether he's using this mailbox regularly. Many users have
      mailboxes that they use rarely or never. For example, don't
      try to send mail to my mailbox on Dow Jones/News Retrieval. 
      I only use this service sporadically. 
           Think of the easiest way for a recipient to respond 
      before sending a message to him or her. 

    * You need to know how to rewrite the recipient's address to
      fit your system. For example, you may have to use a domain 
      address to send through Internet, and a different form when 
      sending through an X.400 network. (More about this later.)

    * The recipient's mailbox system may be connected to a network
      that does not have a mail exchange agreement with your 
      system's network(s). Sometimes, you can use a commercial mail 
      relay service to get your message across (see chapter 9). 
      Users of the Internet can send messages to recipients on the 
      Dialcom network through the DASnet relay service. 

    * Sometimes, you need to know how to route a message through 
      other systems to arrive at its destination. For example, a 
      message sent from the Ulrik computer in Oslo must be routed 
      through a center in London to get to Dominique Christian on 
      the Difer system in Paris (France), 

Internet
--------
is the name of a computer network (here called "INTERNET"), and 
a term used of a global web of systems and networks that can 
exchange mail with each other (here called "Internet"). 
    INTERNET is a very large network that has grown out of ARPANET, 
MILNET, and other American networks for research and education. 
This core network has many gateways to other systems, and it's when 
we include these systems and their connections that we call it the 
Internet. Others call it WorldNet or the Matrix. 
    Internet users can exchange mail with users on networks like
EUnet, JANET, Uninett, BITNET, UUCP, CompuServe, MCI Mail, EcoNet, 
PeaceNet, ConflicNet, GreenNet, Web, Pegasus, AppleLink, Alternex, 
Nicarao, FredsNaetet, UUNET, PSI, Usenet, FidoNet and many others. 
We therefore say that these networks are also "on the Internet." 
    If you have access to the Internet, you can send email to users 
of online services all over the world. You can send to people using 
Bergen By Byte and Telemax in Norway, TWICS in Tokyo, and Colnet in 
Buenos Aires. 
    Now is the time to take a closer look at the art of addressing 
mail through the Internet. 

Domain name addressing
----------------------
On the Internet, the general form of a person's email address is: 

    user-name@somewhere.domain

My main, international Internet mailbox address is: 

    opresno@extern.uio.no

You read the address from left to right. First, the local name of 
the mailbox (my name abbreviated). Next, the name of the mailbox 
system or another identification code (in this case EXTERN, to 
show that I have no affiliation with the University), the name of 
the institution or company (here UIO or "Universitetet i Oslo"), 
and finally the country (NO for Norway). 
    People have sent mail to my mailbox from New Zealand, Zimbabwe, 
Guatemala, Peru, India, China, Greece, Iceland, and Armenia using 
this address. 
    Some users must send their messages through a gateway to the 
Internet. In these cases, the address may have to be changed to 
reflect this: 
    Users of AppleLink use opresno@extern.uio.no@INTERNET# . Those
on JANET use opresno%extern.uio.no@eanrelay.ac.uk. On SprintMail, 
use ("RFC-822": <opresno(a)extern.uio.no>, SITE:INTERNET) . 
CompuServe subscribers use >INTERNET:opresno@extern.uio.no . 
    The core of these address formats is "opresno@extern.uio.no", 
in one way or the other. 
    We call this basic addressing format a Domain Naming System. 
"EXTERN.UIO.NO" is a domain. The domain may also contain reference 
to the name of a company or an organization, like in twics.co.jp, 
compuserve.com, or IGC.ORG. The CO, COM, and ORG codes identify 
TWICS, CompuServe and IGC as companies/organizations. 
    To send mail from the Internet to my CompuServe mailbox, use: 

    75755.1327@compuserve.com

Normally (except on AppleLink), a domain address can only contain 
one @-character. When an address has to be extended with gateway 
routing information, replace all @-characters to the LEFT in the 
address by %-characters. Here is an example: 
    BITNET uses a different addressing method (USER@SYSTEM). Let's 
assume that you are subscribed to the club for lovers of Japanese 
food (J-FOOD-L@JPNKNU10.BITNET, see chapter 6). You have a mailbox 
on INTERNET, and want to send a recipe to the other members using 
the address J-FOOD-L. 
    On some Internet systems, you can simply use the address:
J-FOOD-L@JPNKNU10.BITNET , and your mailbox system will take care 
of the routing for you. 
    If this addressing method doesn't work, you can use different 
gateways into BITNET depending on where you live. The preferred 
method is to route through a gateway near to you. If living in 
North America, you may route CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU using the following 
address: 

    J-FOOD-L%JPNKNU10.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

The rightmost @ in this address is maintained. The one to the LEFT 
has been replaced with a %. The term ".BITNET" tells the gateway 
machine where to forward the message. 
    The following will happen: First, the message will be sent to 
system CUNYVM at the EDUcation site CUNY. CUNYVM investigates the 
address, and discovers that the message is for BITNET. It cuts off 
all text to the right of "JPNKNU10," and replaces the % with an @. 
The message is forwarded to the mailbox J-FOOD-L on the BITNET 
system JPNKNU10 at the Kinki University in Japan. 

Bang addressing
---------------
"Bang" is American for "exclamation point" (!). The UUCP network 
uses this variation of the domain addressing scheme. 
    Example: User Jill Small on Econet in San Francisco used to 
have the address pyramid!cdp!jsmall . Read this address from right 
to left. The name of her mailbox is to the right. The name of the 
organization is in the middle. "Pyramid" is the name of the 
network. 
    Some email systems can use bang addresses directly. (Note that 
the ! character has a special function on Unix computers. Here, you 
may have to type the address as pyramid\!cdp\!jsmall to avoid 
unwanted error messages. The \ character tells Unix to regard the 
next character as a character, and not as a system command. This 
character may also have to precede other special characters.) 
    Other systems do not accept bang addresses directly. Here, the 
users must send such messages through a gateway. The American host 
UUNET is a frequently used gateway. If routing through UUNET, you 
may write the address like this: 

    pyramid!cdp!jsmall@uunet.uu.net

If your system absolutely refuses to accept exclamation points in 
addresses, try to turn the address into a typical Internet address. 
Write the address elements in the Internet sequence (left to 
right). Replace the exclamation points with %-s, like this: 

    jsmall%cdp%pyramid@uunet.uu.net

This method works most of the time. When it works, use this 
addressing form. Bang paths may fail if an intermediate site in the 
path happens to be down. (There is a trend for UUCP sites to 
register Internet domain names. This helps alleviate the problem of 
path failures.) 
    Some messages must be routed through many gateways to reach 
their destination. This is the longest address that I have used, 
and it did work: 

   hpda!hplabs!hpscdc!hp-lsd.cos.hp.com!oldcolo!dave@uunet.uu.net

It used to be the Internet address of a user in Colorado, U.S.A.. 
Today, he can be reached using a much shorter address. 

If you are on UUCP/EUnet, you may use the following address to send 
email to Odd de Presno: 

   extern.uio.no!opresno. 

Addressing international electronic mail sometimes looks like black 
magic. To learn more, read some of the books listed in appendix 5. 
We have found "The Matrix" by John S. Quarterman to be particularly 
useful. 
    The conference INFONETS (General network forum) is another 
source. Here, the INTERNET postmasters discuss their addressing 
problems. Activity is high, and you will learn a lot about the 
noble art of addressing. (This is not the place to ask for Olav 
Janssen's Norwegian email address, though. This question should be 
sent to a Norwegian postmaster.) 
    You can subscribe to Infonets by sending the following mail: 

    To: LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.BITNET
    Subject: (You can write anything here. It will be ignored.)
    TEXT:  SUB INFONETS Your-first-name Your-last-name

If your mailbox is on another network, alter the address to route 
your subscription correctly to this LISTSERV. 

  | Hint: You can search the database of old INFONETS messages by |
  | email to LISTSERV@DEARN.BITNET. See "Directories of services  |
  | and subscribers" below for information about how to search    |
  | LISTSERV databases.                                           |

While the global matrix of networks grows rapidly, it is still 
behind in some lesser-developed nations and poorer parts of 
developed nations. If interested in these parts of the world, check 
out GNET, a library and a journal for documents about the efforts to 
bring the net to lesser-developed nations. 
    Archived documents are available by anonymous ftp from the 
directory global_net at dhvx20.csudh.edu (155.135.1.1). Chapter 12 
has information on how to use FTP if you only have mail access to 
the Internet. 
    To subscribe to a conference discussing these documents, send
a request to gnet_request@dhvx20.csudh.edu. 

cc:Mail gateways
----------------
Many Local Area Networks have been connected to the global Matrix 
of networks. CompuServe offers a cc:Mail gateway. Lotus cc:Mail is 
a PC Lan based email system used in corporate, government and other 
organizations. 
    When sending from CompuServe Mail to a cc:Mail user through 
this gateway, a typical address may look like this: 

    >mhs:pt-support@performa

To send to this user from the Internet through CompuServe's MHS 
gateway, write the address like this: 

    pt-support@performa.mhs.compuserve.com

Other vendors of LAN gateways use other addressing methods. 

X.400 addressing
----------------
X.400 is a standard for electronic mail developed by CCITT. It is 
used on large networks like AT&T Mail, MCI Mail, Sprintnet, GE 
Information System, Dialcom, and Western Union, and on other public 
and private networks throughout the world. 
    EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) uses X.400 as a transport 
mechanism for coordination of electronic part ordering, stock 
control and payment. X.400 is used to connect EDI systems between 
companies and suppliers. 
    The X.400 addressing syntax is very different from domain 
addressing. To send a message from an X.400 mailbox to my address 
(opresno@extern.uio.no), you may have to write it like this: 

   (C:NO,ADMD:uninett,PRMD:uninett,O:uio,OU:extern,S:opresno)

Alas, it's not so standard as the domain addressing schemes. On 
other X.400 networks, the address must be written in one of the 
following formats - or in yet other ways: 

   (C:US,A:Telemail,P:Internet,"RFC-822":<opresno(a)extern.uio.no>)

   ("RFC-822": <opresno(a)extern.uio.no>, SITE:INTERNET)

   '(C:USA,A:TELEMAIL,P:INTERNET,"RFC-822":<opresno<a>extern.uio.no>) DEL'

   (site: INTERNET,ID: <opresno<a>extern.uio.no>)

   "RFC-822=opresno(a)extern.uio.no @ GATEWAY]INTERNET/TELEMAIL/US"

To send an Internet message to a mailbox I once had on the X.400 
host Telemax in Norway, I had to use the following address: 

   /I=D/G=ODD/S=PRESNO/O=KUD.DATASEKR/@PCMAX.telemax.no

To send from Internet to Telemail in the US, I have used this 
address: 

   /PN=TELEMAIL.T.SUPPORT/O=TELENET.MAIL/ADMD=TELEMAIL/C=US/@sprint.com

If you need to route your message through gateways, then complexity 
increases. One Norwegian UUCP user had to use the following address 
to get through: 

  nuug!extern.uio.no!"pcmax.telemax.no!/I=D/G=ODD/S=PRESNO/O=KUD.DATASEKR/"

To send a message from an X.400 system to my CompuServe mailbox, 
I have used the following address elements: 

       Country = US
       ADMD = CompuServe
       PRMD = CSMail
       DDA = 75755.1327

The addressing methods used on X.400 systems vary. Another example: 
Some use the code C:USA rather than the ISO country code C:US. MCI 
Mail uses C:NORWAY, C:USA, and C:SWEDEN. 
    Here are some important X.400 codes: 

    C       the ISO country code (on most services)
    ADMD    domain code for public system (abbreviation A)
    PRMD    domain code for connected private system 
            (abbreviation P)
    O       organization name 
    OU      organization unit
    S       surname (last name)
    G       given name (first name)
    I       initials (in the name) 
    DDA     domain-defined attributes, keywords defined and 
            used by the individual systems to specify mailboxes
            (user name, list, station, user code, etc.), direct
            delivery devices (attention name, telex addresses,
            facsimile, etc.)
    PN      personal name 
    (a)     the character @ cannot be used when routing messages
            from X.400 to Internet. Try (a) instead.
    (p)     the character % cannot be used when routing messages
            from X.400 to Internet. Try (p) instead.
    (b)     the character ! (used in "bang" addresses).
    (q)     the character " used in email addresses.
    RFC-822 this code tells X.400 that an Internet domain address
            follows. Does not work on all X.400 systems.

Returned mail
-------------
When an email address is incorrect in some way (the system's name 
is wrong, the domain doesn't exist, whatever), the mail system will 
bounce the message back to the sender.
    The returned message will include the reason for the bounce. A 
common error is addressing mail to an account name that doesn't 
exist. 
    Let's make an error when sending to LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu. 
Enter "pistserv@vm1.nodak.edu" instead of "LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu". 
    This address is wrong. Below, we've printed the complete 
bounced message. It contains a lot of technical information. Most 
lines have no interest. Also, the message is much larger than the 
original message, which contained three lines only. 
    When browsing the bounced message, note that it has three 
distinct parts: (1) The mail header of the bounced message itself 
(here, the 13 first lines), (2) The text of the error report (from 
line 14 until the line "Original message follows:"), and (3) the 
mailer header and text of your original message (as received by 
computer reporting the error):

The first part of the bounced message is usually of no interest. 
Hidden in the second part you'll find the following interesting 
line: 

  554 No such local user: PISTSERV

Ah, a typo! 
    If your original message was long, you're likely to be pleased 
by having the complete text returned in the third part of the 
bounced message. Now, you may get away with a quick cut and paste, 
before resending it to the corrected address. 
    The text and codes used in bounced messages vary depending on 
what type of mailbox system you're using, and the type of system 
that is bouncing your mail. 
   Above, MAILER@VM1.NoDak.EDU returned the full text of my bounced 
mail. Some systems just send the beginning of your original text, 
while others (in particular some X.400 systems) send nothing but a 
note telling you the reason for the bounce. 

  | Note: When you fail to understand why a message is being  |
  | bounced, contact your local postmaster for help. Send him |
  | a copy of the complete text of the bounced message up to  |
  | and including the line "Subject:" at the bottom.          |
  |    You do not have to send him the text of your original  |
  | message!                                                  |

Replying to an Internet message
-------------------------------
On the Internet, electronic messages have a common structure that 
is common across the network. On some systems, you can reply by 
using a reply command. If this feature is not available, use the 
sender's address as given in the mail header. 
    The bounced message contained two mail headers: the header of 
my original message (in part three), and the header of the bounced 
message (in part one). 
    The 'good' reply address is laid out in the 'From:' header. 
Thus, this message contains the following two 'good' addresses: 

  From: Network Mailer <MAILER@VM1.NoDak.EDU>
  From: opresno@extern.uio.no

The Network Mailer located the second address line above in my 
original message, and used this address when sending the bounced 
message. (Note: there is no point in sending a message back to 
MAILER@VM1.NoDak.EDU since this is the address of an automatic mail 
handling program. Write to Postmaster@VM1.NoDak.EDU to talk to a 
"real person" at this computer center.) 
    The exact order of a message's header may vary from system to 
system, but it will always contain the vital 'From:' line.

  | Note: Exercise caution when replying to a message sent by  |
  | a mailing list. If you wish to respond to the author only, |
  | make sure that the only address you're replying to is that |
  | person's. Don't send it to the entire list!                |

Directories of services and subscribers
---------------------------------------
There is no complete global directory of available electronic 
addresses. On many systems, however, you can search lists of local 
users. 

  | Normally, you'd be better off by calling the recipient for |
  | his or her email address.                                  |

Sometimes, the information given you by the recipient is not enough. 
Maybe the address needs an extension for the message to be routed 
through gateways to the destination. 
    Another typical problem is that the syntax of the address is 
wrong. Perhaps you made a mistake, when you wrote it down (KIDCAFE 
became KIDSCAFE). 
    The return address in the received messages' mailer headers may 
be wrong. It may use a syntax that is illegal on you email system, 
or it may suggest a routing that is unknown to your system. When 
trying to send mail to this address, the Mailer-Daemon complains: 
"This is a non-existent address." 
    Again, the first person to contact for help is your local 
postmaster. On most Internet hosts this is simple. If you have a 
mailbox on the ULRIK computer at the University of Oslo, send a 
request for help to postmaster@ulrik.uio.no . If you are on COLNET 
in Buenos Aires, send to postmaster@colnetr.edu.ar . 
    POSTMASTER is also the address to turn to on BITNET. Users of 
FidoNet or RelayNet, should write to SYSOP. 
    It may not be that simple to locate the postmaster on UUCP. 
The postmaster ID may exist on some systems, but often he's just a 
name or a user code. 
    You can get the email address of known Internet systems by 
sending a message to SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL . In the subject of the 
message, write the command WHOIS host-machine-name. Do not write 
anything in the text (will be ignored). You will get a report of
the desired mailbox computer, and the address of the local 
postmaster.  Example: 

    To:       SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL
    Subject:  WHOIS AERO.ORG
    Text:

Sometimes, you just don't know the name of a recipient's mailbox 
computer. When this is the case, start at the "top of the pyramid." 
    Say your desired recipient lives in Germany. The ISO country 
code for Germany is DE (see appendix 6). Send the message 

    To:       SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL
    Subject:  WHOIS DOMAIN DE
    Text:

This will give you the email addresses of the main postmasters for 
this country. Most postmasters are willing to help, but please note 
that most of them are very busy people. It may take days before 
they get around to respond to your inquiry. 
    There are over 100 other "whois-servers" in more than 15 
countries. The systems whois.nic.ad.jp and whois.ripe.net cover 
Japan and Europe. The rest of them provide information about local 
users. (A list is available via anonymous FTP from sipb.mit.edu in 
the file /pub/whois/whois-servers.list . Chapter 12 has information 
about how to get this list by email). 
    If your recipient is on UUCP, try netdir@mcsun.eu.net . To 
locate the postmaster of the mailbox system "amanpt1", use the 
following format (write nothing in the text): 

    To:       netdir@mcsun.eu.net
    Subject:  amanpt1
    Text:

BITNET provides information about connected systems through many 
sources. Scandinavian users use LISTSERV@FINHUTC.BITNET in Finland. 
Try a LISTSERV on a host closer to where you live. For example, 
North American users may use LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.BITNET, which is a 
host in North Dakota.   Japanese users should write to the host
LISTSERV@JPNKNU10.BITNET. 
    When retrieving for BITNET host information mail, your search 
will have to be done in two steps. Here, your commands are NOT to 
be entered on the Subject line. Enter all commands in the TEXT 
field (text on the Subject line will be ignored). Example: 

    You want information about the BITNET computer FINHUTC (called
    a "node in the network"). Your first message should have the 
    following text: 


      // job echo=no
      database search dd=rules
      //rules dd *
      search * in bitearn where node = FINHUTC
      index

    LISTSERV sends you the following report:

      > search * in bitearn where node = FINHUTC
      --> Database BITEARN, 1 hit.

      > index
      Ref# Conn  Nodeid   Site name
      ---- ----  ------   ---------
      0910 85/11 FINHUTC  Helsinki University of Technology, Finland

    Send a new search message to the LISTSERV containing the same 
    commands as above. Add one line in which you ask for database 
    record number 0910 (given in the column Ref#). 
    Like this:

      // job echo=no
      database search dd=rules
      //rules dd *
      search * in bitearn where node = FINHUTC
      index
      print 0910

    LISTSERV will return a report with a lot of information. 
    Here is part of it: 

      Node: FINHUTC
      Country: FI
      Internet: FINHUTC.hut.fi
      Net: EARN
      Nodedesc: Helsinki University of Technology, Finland
      P_hsalmine: Harri Salminen;LK-HS@FINHUTC;+358 0 4514318
      P_pautio: Petri Autio;POSTMAST@FINHUTC;+358 0 4514318
      P_vvoutila: Vuokko Voutilainen;OPR@FINHUTC;+358 0 4514342
      Routtab: RSCS (NETSERV,POSTMAST@FINHUTC)

For more information about searching BITNET databases, send this
message to your favorite LISTSERV, or use the address below: 

    To:       LISTSERV@FINHUTC.BITNET
    Subject:  nothing
    TEXT:     GET LISTDB MEMO

X.400 systems are developing an address directory according to 
CCITT standard X.500. The plan is to connect several directories. 
The developers hope that routing of X.400 messages may eventually 
be done automatically without the user needing to know the identity 
of the recipient's mailbox computer. 
    X.500 will certainly help X.400 users. The problem is that 
most email is still carried by other types of systems, and that 
X.500 has no concern for mail transported through "foreign 
systems." 

Dialcom
-------
is a commercial, global online service, which have many nodes in 
Africa and Latin America. To send mail from Dialcom to the Internet 
you must use commercial gateway-services like DASnet (see appendix 
1). 
    To send mail from one Dialcom system to another, use the syntax 
6007:EWP002. This address points to mailbox EWP002 on system number 
6007. 
    To send mail from Internet to Dialcom user YNP079 on system 
10001, use the following address when sending through DASnet:

    10001_ynp079@dcdial.das.net

Note: Only registered users with DASnet can use this method. 

FidoNet
-------
Users of this global network can send and receive mail to/from the 
Internet. For example, a FidoNet user may use the following method 
to send to my Internet address: 

    Send the message to user UUCP at 1:105/42. The first line of 
    the TEXT of the message should contain:

      To: opresno@extern.uio.no 

    Add a blank line after the address before entering the text
    of your message.

FidoNet addresses are composed by three or four numbers;

        zone:net/node
        or
        zone:net/node.point

The FidoNet address 1:105/42 has three elements. "1:" tells that 
the recipient lives in Zone number 1 (North America). "105/42" 
refers to Node number 42, which receives mail through Net number 
105. This node has an automatic gateway to the Internet. 
    Another example: Jan Stozek is sysop of "Home of PCQ" in 
Warsaw, Poland. The Node number of his BBS is 10. He receives mail 
through Net number 480. Poland is a country in Europe, Zone number 
2. The address to his system is: 2:480/10. His user name is Jan 
Stozek. 
    You can send an Internet message to anyone in FidoNet by using 
the following template: 

 <firstname>.<lastname>@p<point>.f<node>.n<net>.z<zone>.fidonet.org

Where <firstname> is the person's first name
      <lastname>  is the person's last name

To send a message from the Internet to Jan, use this address: 

    Jan.Stozek@f10.n480.z2.fidonet.org

One final example: Ola Garstad in Oslo has the FidoNet address 
2:502/15. Use the address Ola.Garstad@f15.n502.z2.fidonet.org , 
when sending mail to him through the Internet. 
    An updated list of global FidoNet nodes can be retrieved from 
most connected BBS systems.

If you have access to BITNET or Internet mail, get "The Inter-
Network Mail Guide." It describes how to send mail between 
electronic mail systems like AppleLink, BITNET, BIX, CompuServe, 
Connect-USA, EasyNet, Envoy, FidoNet, GeoNet, Internet, MCI, 
MFENET, NasaMail, PeaceNet, Sinet, Span, SprintMail, and more. 
    Send a message to the BITNET address LISTSERV@UNMVM.BITNET. In 
the TEXT of the message enter:

Chapter 8: Free expert assistance
=================================

This may sound too good to be true. Many computer experts are ready 
to help YOU without asking a dollar in return. The same is the case 
with experts in other areas. 
    You have an impossible decision to make. A lawyer has a dotted 
line that requires your signature, or a surgeon has a dotted line 
in mind for your upper abdomen. You're not comfortable with the 
fine print or the diagnosis and wonder if a second opinion is in 
order. Just ask, and get help.
    If you have problems with your communications program, post a 
message on a bulletin board. Do the same thing if you want to sell 
equipment. Learn from other people's experiences with computers or 
software that you plan to buy. 
    You will get a reply - if the subject or you attract interest. 
In the process, you'll get new friends, and be able to follow the 
development in a dynamic marketplace. 
    The following message from CompuServe is typical: 


  16-Nov-91  15:16:14
  Sb: Back & Forth software
  Fm: Joan Healy 
  To: John Nelson

  Changed my mind about GrandView:
 
  1. Learning curve like Mt. Everest.  Give me intuitive or give me 
     death. 
  2. Lack of patience with "  ".
  3. Lack of time.
  4. It may be unsuited for what I wanted (outlining a book). Since 
     becoming a born-again Galaxian, I've started using that for the 
     outline, and I'm happy.  There's nothing like a  decision and a 
     permanent bonding and lifelong commitment to make a woman 
     happy. Remember that, you louts. :-) 

Many users prefer open conference messages to private email for 
their technical discussions. This gives "the group" a chance to 
read, comment, provide additional facts, and return with new 
questions. 
    The reactions to one simple question may be overwhelming, but 
most of the time the contributions are useful and educational. 
Since the discussion is public, regard it as your personal online 
university. Offer opinions when you have something to contribute, 
or keep silent. 
    In most conferences, some members are critical to "lurkers." A 
"lurker" is someone who read without ever contributing. Don't let 
them get to you. Do not feel bad about being silent. Most other 
members are there only to watch and learn as well. 
    If you consider buying a newly released computer program, tune 
in to the section of your favorite online service that deals with 
products from this manufacturer. Count messages with complaints 
of the new program before buying. 
    When you have received your new program, return to read other 
users' experiences and to pick up practical advice. It will never 
hurt to offer your own two cents' worth in the process. 

  | Visit online services that have many users who know more than   |
  | most. There, you will usually get faster and better replies to  |
  | your questions. It is far cheaper to ask than to search.        |

Start with bulletin boards. If you have never visited a BBS, call 
one in your neighborhood to get a feel for what this is. Most of
them can be accessed free. Usually, their only requirement is that 
you answer some self-presentation questions before being granted 
full access to their system. 
    Most bulletin boards offer conferencing and archives filled 
with shareware and public domain software. Many also have files or 
bulletins listing telephone numbers of other boards in your country 
or area. 
    The trick is to find know-how. The larger the online service, 
the more skilled people are likely to "meet" there regularly. 
Therefore, if local bulletin boards fail to satisfy your needs, 
visit the large commercial services. CompuServe and EXEC-PC are two 
services in the top league. BIX is another good source of 
information for professional computer specialists. 
    One exception: When you need contact with ONE particular 
person, who knows YOUR problem in detail, go where he uses to go. 
    Examples: If you need top advice about the communications 
program GALINK, call Mike's BBS in Oslo (at +472 -416588). If you 
buy modems from Semafor A/S, the best place for expert advice is 
Semaforum BBS (tel. +4741-370-11710). If you have a Novell local 
area network, visit the Novell forums on CompuServe. 

For users of MS-DOS computers
-----------------------------
I visit the following CompuServe forums regularly: 

    IBM Communication - about communication software for MS-DOS 
        computers. 
    IBM Hardware - about new IBM compatibles, expansion cards, 
        displays, hard disks, IBM PS/2, software for performance 
        evaluation, printers, etc. 
    IBM Systems/Utilities - about DOS, utilities, shells, file 
        utilities, and much more. A large software library. 
    IBM Applications - about all kind of applications. The forum 
        has a large file library full of shareware and public 
        domain software. 

Many CompuServe forums are operated or sponsored by software and 
hardware vendors, like: 

    Adobe Systems Inc., Aldus Corp., Ashton-Tate Corp., Autodesk 
Inc., Borland International, Broderbund Software Inc., Buttonware

    Abstracts of comp.sys.amiga conferences are available through 
several BITNET mailing lists, like AMIGAHAR@DEARN, AMIGA-D@NDSUVM1, 
and AMIGA-S@NDSUVM1. 
    Most online services have "Find this File" commands. The most 
powerful ones are often found on free bulletin boards. 
    On CompuServe, type GO AMIGA to get to CBMNET and get the 
following welcome menu:

   This is a modified Comm1.34.  It supports both VT100 and ANSI. 
   The VT100 emulation is based on Dave Wecker's VT100 program. 
   There is automatic dialer, split screen that is configurable, 
   phone book, and other nice features. 

This is what we were looking for. First, enter GO AMIGAUSER to get 
to the forum. Enter "DL 5" to get to Downloading Library number 5. 
INTOUCH.ARC was retrieved using the CompuServe Quick B transfer 
protocol. This protocol is usually the most efficient choice on 
this service. 
    There are also active Amiga forums on BIX, GEnie, and CIX 
(England). 

Apple users
-----------
FidoNet has an APPLE conference. BITNET has APPLE2-L (APPLE2-
L@BROWNVM). CompuServe has Apple II Programmers Forum, Apple II 
Users Forum, Apple II Vendor Forum, Mac Community Clubhouse Forum, 
Mac Developers Forum, Mac Fun/Entertainment Forum, Mac Hypertext 
Forum, Mac New Users/Help Forum, Mac System 7.0 Forum, Mac System 
Software Forum, MacUser Forum and MacWEEK Forum. 
    Similar services are found on many other online services. You 
will also find conferences devoted to support of popular commercial 
software for Apple computers. 

Other computers
---------------
There are so many types of computers: Atari computers, the TRS-80 
series and others from Tandy, DEC computers, mainframes from IBM, 
Hewlett-Packard computers, CP/M machines, users of LDOS/TRSDOS or 
OS9, Apricot, Z88, Timex/Sinclair, Archimedes, Psion, and Armstrad. 
    Even so, there is a high probability that you can find online 
support for almost all of them. This is so even if the vendor is 
out of business long ago. CompuServe is a good place to start. 

Chapter 9: Your electronic daily news
=====================================

   Read national and global news before they are announced by 
   the traditional media. Get those interesting background 
   facts. Read special interest news stories that seldom 
   appear in print. 

Sure, you read newspapers, watch TV, and listen to radio. But did 
you know how limited their stories are? 
    Traditional news media just give you a small part of the news. 
Their editors are not concerned about YOUR particular interests. 
They serve a large group of readers, viewers or listeners with 
different interests in mind. 
    Go online to discover the difference. The online news has an 
enormous width and depth. Besides "popular" news, you will find 
stories that few editors bother to print. This may give you better 
insight in current developments, and in as much details as you can 
take. 
    Most commercial online services offer news. Most of their 
stories come from large news agencies and newspapers. You can also 
read and search articles from magazines, newsletters and other 
special publications. 
    The online users' ability to search today and yesterday's news 
makes these offerings particularly useful. 
    The cost of reading a given news item varies by online service. 
What will set you back 20 cents on one service, will cost you two 
dollars on another. 
    It may be many times more expensive (or cheap) to read the same 
article from the same news provider on another online service. So,
professional online users compare prices. 

National news
-------------
In Norway, we have long been able to read local language news from 
print media like Aftenposten, Dagens Naeringsliv, Kapital, and news 
wires from NTB and other local sources. Similarly, local language 
news is available online in most countries. 
    The cost of reading local news on national online services 
tends to be more expensive than on major global online services. As 
competition among global news providers increases, however, this is 
bound to change. 

International news
------------------
"The Global Village" is an old idea in the online world. News from 
most parts of the world has long been globally available. 
    A while ago, a well-known Norwegian industrialist visited my 
office. I showed off online searching in NewsNet newsletters and 
stumbled over a story about his company. "Incredible!" he said. "We 
haven't even told our Norwegian employees about this yet." 
    Often, American online services give news from other countries 
earlier you can get it on online services from these countries. 
Besides, the stories will be in English. 

  | In 1991, the United States had 56 percent of the world's online |
  | databases (Source: the research company IQ, September 1991).    |

Sure, most Norwegians prefer to read news in Norwegian. The 
Japanese want news in their language, and the French in French. If 
they can get the news earlier than their competitors, however, most 
are willing to read English. 
    Few master many languages. Unless you live in a country where 
they talk Arabic, Chinese or French, chances are that you cannot 
read news in these languages. English, however, is a popular second 
choice in many countries, and it has become the unofficial language 
of the online world. 
    Another thing is that reading local language news is risky. 
Translators often make mistakes. One reason is time pressure, 
another poor knowledge of the source language. 
    The risk of inaccuracies increases when a story, for example 
initially translated from Spanish into English, then are being 
translated into a third language. 
    Avoid news that has been translated more than once. If not, 
you may experience something like this: 

    On September 19, 1991, Norwegian TV brought news from Moscow.
    They told that Russian president Boris Yeltsin had a heart 
    attack. 

    The online report from Associated Press, which arrived 7.5 
    hours earlier, talked about "a minor heart attack" with the
    following additional explanation: "In Russian, the phrase 
    'heart attack' has a broader meaning than in English. It is 
    commonly used to refer to a range of ailments from chest pains 
    to actual heart failure." 

Your "personal online daily newspaper" will often give you the news 
faster and more correctly than traditional print media. Some news 
is only made available in electronic form. 

Seven minutes in 1991
---------------------
On September 19, I called CompuServe to read news and gather 
information about online news sources. 
    According to my log, I connected through Infonet in Oslo (see 
Chapter 13). The total cost for seven minutes was US$6.00, which 
included the cost of a long distance call to Oslo. 
    I read some stories, while they scrolled over the screen. All
was captured to a file on my hard disk for later study. The size 
of this file grew to 32.000 characters, or almost 15 single-spaced 
typewritten pages (A-4 size). If I had spent less time reviewing 
the lists of available stories, seven minutes would have given a 
larger file. 
    When I had entered my user ID and password, a menu of stories 
came up on my screen. The headline read "News from CompuServe." 
    The two first items caught my attention, and I requested the 
text. One had 20 lines about an easier method of finding files in 
the forum libraries. The other had ten lines about how to write 
addresses for international fax messages. 
    The command GO APV brought me directly to Associated Press News 
Wires. You'll find such tricks by reading the online services' user 
manuals. This command produced the following menu: 

    AP Online                  APV-1

     1 Latest News-Updated Hourly
     2 Weather
     3 Sports
     4 National
     5 Washington
     6 World
     7 Political
     8 Entertainment
     9 Business News
    10 Wall Street
    11 Dow Jones Average
    12 Feature News
    13 Today in History

I entered "9" for business news, and got a new list of stories: 

    AP Online

    1 Women, Minority Businesses Lag
    2 Child World Accuses Toys R Us
    3 UPI May Cancel Worker Benefits
    4 Drilling Plan Worries Florida
    5 UK Stocks Dip, Tokyo's Higher
    6 Dollar Higher, Gold Up
    7 Farm Exports Seen Declining
    8 Supermarket Coupons Big Bucks
    9 Cattlemen Tout Supply, Prices
    0 Tokyo Stocks, Dollar Higher

    MORE !

The screen stopped scrolling by "MORE !". Pressing ENTER gave a new 
list. None of them were of any interest. 
    Pressing M (for previous menu) returned me to the APV-1 menu 
(the videotext page number is given in the upper right corner of 
each menu display). I selected "World" for global news, which gave
me this list: 


    AP Online

    6 Two Killed In Nagorno Karabakh
    7 Yugoslavia Fighting Rages On
    8 Storm Kills Five In Japan
    9 Afghan Rebels Going To Moscow?
    0 19 Killed in Guatemala Quakes

    MORE !8

Oh, a storm in Japan! Interesting. I was due to leave for Japan in 
a couple of weeks, and entered 8 at the MORE ! prompt to read. A 
screenful of text was transferred in a few seconds. 
    "This is for later study," I said, pressed M to return to the 
menu, and then ENTER to get the next listing: 


    AP Online

    1 Bomblets Kill American Troops?
    2 No Movement On Hostage Release
    3 Baker Plans Return To Syria
    4 Baker, King Hussein To Confer
    5 Madame Chiang Leaving Taiwan?
    6 Baker Leaves Syria for Jordan
    7 Klaus Barbie Hospitalized
    8 Iraq Denounces U.S. Threat
    9 Yelstin Said Resting At Home
    0 SS Auschwitz Guard Found Dead

    MORE !

Here, I used another trick from the user manual. Entering "5,6,9" 
gave three stories in one batch with no pauses between them. Five 
screens with text. If I had read the menu more carefully, I might 
probably also have selected story 0. It looked like an interesting 
item. 
    "This is enough of the Associated Press," I thought,  and typed
G NEWS. This gave me an overview of all available news sources ("G 
NEWS" is an abbreviation for "GO NEWS," or "GO to the main NEWS 
menu"): 


    News/Weather/Sports         NEWS

     1 Executive News Service ($)
     2 NewsGrid
     3 Associated Press Online
     4 Weather
     5 Sports
     6 The Business Wire
     7 Newspaper Library
     8 UK News/Sports
     9 Entertainment News/Info
    10 Online Today Daily Edition
    11 Soviet Crisis

First, a quick glance at 6. The service presented itself in these 
words: "Throughout the day The Business Wire makes available press 
releases, news stories, and other information from the world of 
business.  Information on hundreds of different companies is 
transmitted daily to The Business Wire's subscribers." 
    Then #7: "This database contains selected full-text stories 
from 48 newspapers from across the United States. Classified ads 
are NOT included in the full-text of each paper." 
    The list of newspapers included Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune 
and San Francisco Chronicle (known for many interesting inside 
stories from Silicon Valley). 
    Choice 8 gave news from England. There, I selected UK News 
Clips, which gave the following options: 

  U.K. News Clips

   93 stories selected

   1 RTw  09/19 0818  YUGOSLAV AIR FORCE HITS CROATIAN COMMUNICATIONS
   2 RTw  09/19 0755  CROATIA BATTLES CONTINUE AS EC PONDERS PEACE FORCE
   3 RTw  09/19 0753  ARAB PAPERS SAY MOSCOW WANTS MIDEAST PARLEY DELAYED
   4 RTw  09/19 0749  DOLLAR STANDS STILL, SHARES DRIFT LOWER IN ...
   5 RTw  09/19 0729  EARNINGS GLOOM REVERSES LONDON STOCKS' EARLY GAINS
   6 RTw  09/19 0716  SOVIETS NEED 14.7 BILLION DOLLARS FOOD AID, EC SAYS
   7 RTw  09/19 0707  IRA SAYS IT KILLED TIMBER YARD WORKER IN BELFAST DOCKS
   8 RTw  09/19 0706  BRITISH CONSERVATIVE CHIEF PLAYS DOWN TALK OF ...
   9 RTw  09/19 0630  FINANCE RATES
  10 RTw  09/19 0603  REUTER WORLD NEWS SCHEDULE AT 1000 GMT THURSDAY ...

The numbers in column four are the release times of the stories. 
They flow in from the wires in a continuous stream. 
    Next stop was the UK Newspaper Library. Here, you can search in 
full-text stories from The Daily and Sunday Telegraph, Financial 
Times, The Guardian, UK News (with selected stories from The Daily 
& Sunday Telegraph, Financial Times, The Guardian, The Times/Sunday 
Times, Today, The Independent, Lloyd's List and The Observer). 
    Searching the UK Newspaper Library costs US$6.00 for up to ten 
hits. You get a selection menu of the first ten stories found. A 
menu with an additional ten stories costs another $6.00, etc. You 
pay US$6.00 to read the full text of selected stories. These rates 
are added to CompuServe's normal access rates.
    The news service Soviet Crisis was my final destination. This 
was just a few weeks after the attempted coup in Moscow, and I was 
eager for reports. 
    I found the following interesting story from OTC NewsAlert: 

OTC  09/19 0750  FIRST ENGLISH LANGUAGE SOVDATA DAILINE IS LAUNCHED

This selection gave me three screens with information about a new 
online service. Briefly, this is what it said: 

   "The SovData DiaLine service includes an on-line library of more 
   than 250 Soviet newspapers, business and economic periodicals, 
   profiles of more than 2,500 Soviet firms and key executives that 
   do business with the West, legislative reports and other 
   information."

It also said that part of the database was available through Mead 
Data Central (Nexis/Lexis), and that it would be made available 
through like Data-Star, FT Profile, Reuters, Westlaw, and GBI. 
Undoubtedly, the name has changed by the time you read this.
    Finally, a fresh story about the fate of KGB. I read another 
fifty lines, entered OFF (for "goodbye CompuServe"), and received 
the following verdict: 

    Thank you for using CompuServe!

    Off at 09:03 EDT 19-Sep-91
    Connect time = 0:07

Seven minutes. Fifteen typed pages of text. US$6.00. Not bad!

An overwhelming choice
----------------------
I am confident that your "daily online newspaper" will contain 
other stories. If you're into computers, you may want to start with 
Online Today, CompuServe's daily newspaper. It brings short, 
informative news stories about the computer industry. 
    NewsBytes is another interesting source for computer news. It 
offers global headline news from its bureaus around the world. The 
articles are sorted in sections called APPLE, BUSINESS, GENERAL, 
GOVERNMENT, IBM, REVIEW, TELECOM, TRENDS and UNIX. A favorite! 
    Newsnet is also available through Genie, ZiffNet on CompuServe, 
NewsNet, Dialog, in the newsgroup clari.nb on Usenet, and various 
BBS systems around the world. I read it through a Norwegian BBS
(EuroNet in Haugesund). 
    For general news, start with major newswires, like Associated 
Press, Agence France-Presse, Xinhua, Reuters, and the like. You 
will find them on many commercial services including NewsNet, 
CompuServe, and Dialog. 

FROGNET - The French Way

News is more than news 
----------------------
After some time, your definition of the notion "news" may change. 
Since so many conferences are interesting sources, they should also 
be a part of your news gathering strategy. Check in regularly to 
read what members report about what they have seen, done, heard, or 
discovered. 
    By the way, professional news hunters have also discovered 
this. Online conferences are popular hunting grounds for reporters 
of the traditional press. 
    FidoNet has many conferences with specialized news contents: 

      ANEWS                 News of the US and World
      BBNS                  BBS News Service
      BIONEWS               Environmental News
      EL_SALVADOR           Analysis and News About El Salvador
      NICANET               Analysis and News About Nicaragua
      PACIFIC_NEWS          Pacific News
      PANAMA                Analysis and News About Panama

BITNET has mailing lists like:

      CHINA-NN         CHINA-NN@ASUACAD  China News Digest (Global News)
      CURRENTS         CURRENTS@PCCVM    South Asian News and Culture 
      INDIA-L          INDIA-L@TEMPLEVM  The India News Network
      PAKISTAN         PAKISTAN@ASUACAD  Pakistan News Service
      SEDSNEWS         SEDSNEWS@TAMVM1   News about Space from SEDS
      TSSNEWS          TSSNEWS@PSUVM     Tunisian Scientific Society News

RFERL-L (on LISTSERV@UBVM.CC.BUFFALO.EDU) distributes the RFE/RL 
Research Institute Daily Report. It is a digest of the latest 
developments in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  The 
report is published Monday through Friday by the RFE/RL Research 
Institute, a division of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Inc. in 
Germany. 
     Some mailing lists bring a steady flow of news from various 
sources. SEASIA-L@MSU - The Southeast Asia Discussion List - is one 
example. The list is "designed to facilitate communication between 
researchers, scholars, students, teachers, and others interested in 
Southeast Asian studies with an emphasis on current events." 
    SEASIA-L defines Southeast Asia loosely as Burma/Myanmar across 
to Hong Kong and down through Australia and New Zealand. Regularly, 
it brings full-text news stories from Inter Press Service, regional 
news agencies, and newspapers/radio. Some examples:
    On Jul. 30, 1992, a full-text story from IPS:  "PHILIPPINES: 
RAMOS URGES REPEAL OF ANTI-COMMUNIST LAW." On Aug. 13, 1992, full-
text story from The New Straits Times (Singapore): "Schoolgirs 
involved in flesh trade, says Farid." On Aug. 31, "ANTI-VIETNAMESE 
FORCE TURNS UP IN CAMBODIA" (Reuter). 
    SEASIA-L also brings "underground" reports like "The Burma 
Focus," a bimonthly newsletter published by the All Burma Students' 
Democratic Front. 
    ECUADOR brings news from Ecuador. Daily news bulletins from 
"Diario Hoy" are posted to the list. Send rone@skat.usc.edu your 
subscription request. 
    Many CompuServe forums have news sections. If you're into Hot 
News and Rumors about Amiga Computers, read messages in section 3 
of the Amiga Tech Forum. 
    Consumer Electronics Forum has the section "New Products/News." 
The Journalist Forum has "Fast Breaking News!" The Motor Sports 
Forum has "Racing News/Notes." The Online Today Forum has "In the 
News." 
    NewsNet's list of newsletters that you can read or search 
online is long, and back issues are also available. For example: 

      Africa News, Agence France-Presse International News, Applied 
      Genetics News, Asian Economic News, Asian Political News, 
      Business Travel News, Catholic News Service, CD Computing 
      News, Computer Reseller News, Electronic Materials Technology 
      News, Electronic Trade & Transport News, Electronic World 
      News, High Tech Ceramics News, Inter Press Service 
      International News, International Businessman News Report, 
      News From France, Northern Ireland News Service, Online 
      Product News, Sourcemex -- economic news on Mexico, and 
      XINHUA English language news service (China). 

The Inter Press Service's newsletter International News focuses 
on Third World countries, and news from Europe/North America of 
interest to these countries (also available through Impress on 
Nexis). 
    Usenet brings news from Bangladesh, India and Nepal in 
misc.news.southasia. The ClariNet hierarchy gateways newsgroups

Behind the news
---------------
In an effort to garner new subscribers and retain current readers, 
magazine publishers turn to online services to create an ancillary 
electronic version of their print product. 
    Their readers are being transformed from passive recipients of 
information into active participants in publishing. 
    You can "talk" to BYTE's writers on BIX, and with PC Magazine's 
writers through ZiffNet on CompuServe. Their forums function as 
expert sources. Here, you will often learn about products and trends 
sometimes before the magazines hit the newsstand.

Chapter 10: Looking for a needle in a bottle of hay
===================================================

Experienced users regularly clip news from online services, and 
store selected parts of it on their personal computers' hard disks. 
They use powerful tools to search their data, and know how to use 
the information in other applications. 
    Regular clipping of news is highly recommended. It is often 
quicker and easier to search your own databases than to do it 
online. 
    Since your data is a subset of previous searches, your stories 
are likely to have a high degree of relevancy. 
    There are many powerful programs for personal computers that 
let you search your personal data for information. Read Chapter 14 
for more on this. 
    While secondary research can never replace primary information 
gathering, it often satisfies most information needs related to any 
task or project. Besides, it points in the direction of primary 
sources from where more in-depth information may be elicited. 

When your personal database fails to deliver
--------------------------------------------
Regular "clipping" can indeed help you build a powerful personal 
database, but it will never satisfy all your information needs. 
Occasionally, you must go online for additional facts. 
    When this happens, you may feel like Don Quixote, as he was 
looking "for a needle in a bottle of hay." The large number of 
online offerings is bewildering. To be successful, you must have 
a sound search strategy. 
    Your first task is to locate useful SOURCES of information. The 
next, to decide how best to find that specific piece of information 
online. You must PLAN your search. 
    Although one source of information, like an online database, is 
supposed to cover your area of interest, it may still be unable to 
give you what you want. Let me explain with an example: 

    You're tracking a company called IBM (International Business
    Machines). Your first inclination is to visit forums and clubs
    concerned with products delivered by this company. There, you 
    plan to search message bases and file libraries. 

    What is likely to happen, is that the search term IBM gives so 
    many hits that you almost drown. To find anything of interest 
    in these forums, your search terms must be very specific. 

    General news providers, like Associated Press, may be a better 
    alternative. Usually, they just publish one or two stories on 
    IBM per week. Don't expect to learn about details that are not 
    of interest to the general public. 

    AP's stories may be too general for you. Maybe you'll be more
    content with industry insiders' expert views, as provided by
    the NewsNet newsletters OUTLOOK ON IBM, or THE REPORT ON IBM.

The level of details in a given story depends in part on the news 
providers' readers, and the nature of the source. The amount of 
"noise" (the level of irrelevancy) also varies. In most public 
forums, expect to wade through many uninteresting messages before 
finding things of interest. 
    We suggest the following strategy:

    Step 1: Locate sources that provide relevant information,

    Step 2: Check if the information from these sources is at a
            satisfactory level of details, and that the volume 
            is acceptable (not too much, neither too little). 

    Step 3: Study the service's search commands and procedures, 
            PLAN, and then SEARCH.

Start by asking others!
-----------------------
Step 1 is not an easy one. Start by asking other online people for 
advice. This may be the fastest way to interesting sources. 
    If looking for information about agriculture and fisheries, 
visit conferences about related topics. Ask members there what they 
are using. 
    If you want information about computers or electronics, ask in 
such conferences. 

  | When you don't know where to start your search, ask others! |
  | Their know-how is usually the quickest way to the sources.  |

If this doesn't help, check out GEnie's Home Office/Small Business 
RoundTable, a hangout of online searchers. Visit CompuServe's 
Working From Home Forum, which has a section for information 
professionals (#4), and the section for new librarians in the 
Journalism Forum. 
    Patent searchers are a very specialized group. They discuss 
common problems on Dialog's DialMail. Their bulletin board is named 
PIUG. 

Buy user manuals
----------------
Some online services send free user information manuals to their 
users. Others charge extra for them. If they do, buy! They're worth 
their weight in gold. 
    The user manuals from Dialog, Dow Jones News/Retrieval and 
CompuServe make good reading. The last two also publish monthly 
magazines full of search tips, information about new sources, user 
experiences, and more. Dialog distributes the monthly newsletter 
Chronolog. 
    NewsNet customers periodically receive a printed listing of 
available newsletters by subject area, and a presentation of their 
information providers. The NewsNet Action Letter (monthly) is also 
distributed by mail. 
   On some services, you can retrieve the help texts in electronic 
form. Doing that is not a bad idea. It is often quicker to search a 
help file on your disk, than to browse through a book. 

Monitor the offerings
---------------------
Professional information searchers monitor the activity in the 
online world. They search databases for information about new 
sources of information, and regularly read about new services. 
    On most online services, you can search databases of available 
offerings, and a section with advertisements about their own 
'superiorities'. Keep an eye on what is being posted there. 
    NewsNet lets you read and search the following newsletters:  
Worldwide Videotex Update, Worldwide Databases (#PB44), Online 
Newsletter, The Online Newsletter, and The Online Libraries and 
Microcomputers. 
    The last two are also available as a database from Information 
Intelligence, Inc., (P.O. Box 31098, Phoenix, AZ 85046, U.S.A. 
Tel.: +1-602-996-2283). You can read the text on NewsNet about one 
week before it appears in print. 
    These two newsletters can also be read and searched on Dialog 
and Data-Star, as part of the Information Access PTS Newsletter 
Database. Information Access is a full-text database with many 
specialized newsletters for business and industry. 
    On CompuServe, you can get to Information Access through the 
IQuest gateway to NewsNet. 
    Subscribing to THE ONLINE NEWSLETTER costs US$50.00 per year 
(10 issues) for companies, and US$35.00 for personal use (1991). 
For both newsletters, the price is US$75.00. 
    These newsletters are also available on CD-ROM. The disk 
contains four databases: the Online Newsletter, Online Hotline, 
Online Libraries and Microcomputers, Major Online Vendors and 
*Joblines* with more than eight thousand full-text articles from 
January 1980 until today. 
    The CD-ROM version is delivered with a menu-driven searching 
program. Each word in every article and headline has been indexed 
and can be located in all databases. The price for subscriptions 
of the printed version is US$99.95. Price for nonsubscribers: 
US$199.95. 
    The September 1991 issue of The Online Newsletter had the 
following index (partial):

The European Common Market
--------------------------
Many services bring news and information from the European Common 
Market. The Common Market's free database service,  I'M-GUIDE, is 
a good place to start. 
    I'M-GUIDE is available through ECHO in Luxembourg by telnet to 
echo.lu . At the question "PLEASE ENTER YOUR CODE," enter ECHO and 
press Return. 
    You can search I'M-GUIDE for information sources, send email 
inquiries to ECHO, and more. Searches can be done in English, 
French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, and Portuguese.
    If you have problems using I'M-GUIDE, call the ECHO Help Desk 
in Luxembourg at +352-34 98 11.

Practical hints about online searching
--------------------------------------
We cannot give a simple, universal recipe valid for all online 
services. What is the best approach on one service, may be useless 
on others. 
    Most services offer full online documentation of their search 
commands. You can read the help text on screen while connected, or 
retrieve it for later study. 
    Make a note about the following general tricks:

    In conferences and forums:
    --------------------------
    Many services have commands for selective reading of messages.
    For example, on CompuServe you can limit your search to given 
    sections. You can also select messages to be read based on
    text strings in the subject titles. The command

            rs;s;CIS Access from Japan;62928

    displays all messages with the text "CIS Access from Japan"
    in their subject titles starting with message number 62928.

    Online searching often starts by selecting databases. The
    next step is to enter search words (or text strings), and 
    a valid time frame (as in "between 1/1/90 and 1/1/91").

    The following sample search terms are used on NewsNet:

    VIDEO*                  search for all words starting with
                            VIDEO. "*" is a wild-card character
                            referring to any ending of the word.
                            VIDEO* matches words like VIDEOTEXT 
                            and VIDEOCONFERENCE. 

    SONY AND VIDEO          The word SONY and the word VIDEO. Both
                            words must be present in the document
                            to give a match.

    SONY WITHIN/10 VIDEO    Both words must be present in the text,
                            but they must not be farther apart than
                            ten words. (Proximity operators)

    IBM OR APPLE            Either one word OR the other.

    Many services let you reuse your search terms in new search 
    commands. This can save you time and money, if there are too 
    many hits. For example: if IBM OR APPLE gives 1,000 hits, 
    limit the search by adding "FROM JANUARY 1st.," or by adding
    the search word "NOTEBOOK*". 

    In file libraries
    -----------------
    The commands used to find files are similar to those used in
    traditional databases. Often, you can limit the search by 
    library, date, file name, or file extension. You can search for 
    text strings in the description of the contents of a file, or 
    use key words. 

    Example: You're visiting a bulletin board based on the BBS 
    program RBBS-PC. You want a program that can show GIF graphics 
    picture files.  Such files are typically described like this: 

 VUIMG31.EXE     103105  07-15-91 GIF*/TIFF/PCX Picture Viewer/Printer   

    From left to right: file name, size in bytes, date available,
    and a 40 character description.

    You can search the file descriptions for the string "gif". You
    do this by entering the term "s gif all". This will probably 
    give you a list of files. Some will have the letters GIF in 
    the file name. Others will have them in the description field. 

Using ANDs and ORs
------------------
Boolean searching may seem confusing at first, unless you already 
understand the logic. There are three Boolean operators that 
searchers use to combine search terms: AND, OR, and NOT.
    Use the Boolean operator AND to retrieve smaller amounts of 
information. Use AND when multiple words must be present in your 
search results (MERCEDES AND VOLVO AND CITROEN AND PRICES). 
    Use OR to express related concepts or synonyms for your search 
term (FRUIT OR APPLES OR PEARS OR BANANAS OR PEACHES).
    Be careful when using the NOT operator. It gets rid of any record 
in a database that contains the word that you've "notted" out. For 
example, searching for "IBM NOT APPLE" drops records containing the 
sentence, "IBM and Apple are computer giants." The record will be 
dropped, even if this is the only mention of Apple in an article, 
and though it is solely about IBM. 
    Use NOT to drop sets of hits that you have already seen. Use 
NOT to exclude records with multiple meanings, like "CHIPS Not 
POTATO" (if you are looking for chips rather than snack foods). 
    Often, it pays to start with a "quick-and-dirty" search by 
throwing in words you think will do the trick. Then look at the 
first five or 10 records, but look only at the headline and the
indexing. This will show you what terms are used by indexers to 
describe your idea and the potential for confusion with other 
ideas. 
    Use proximity operators to search multiword terms. If searching 
for "market share," you want the two words within so many words of 
another. The order of the words, however, doesn't matter. You can 
accept both "market share" and "share of the market." 

Searching by email
------------------
MCI Mail and MCI Fax have a program called Information Advantage, 
under which online services and newsletters can deliver search 
results and other information over the online services. Dialog, 
Dun & Bradstreet, NewsNet, and Individual Inc. have signed up for 
the program. 
    You can request a search by direct email to say Dialog. The 
search results will be returned to you via MCI Mail or MCI Fax. 
     With Dun and Bradstreet, you call them for a credit report and 
they send it to you. With History Associates, you send them a 
message via MCI Mail, and they report to you.

Using BITNET discussion lists through Internet
----------------------------------------------
To get a directory of Internet/BITNET mailing lists, send the 
following email message: 

    To:  LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU
    Subject: (keep this blank)
    Text: 
    LIST GLOBAL

You will receive a LONG list of available sources of information. A 
recent copy had over two thousand lines of text. Each mailing list 
is described with one line. All these mailing lists can be used by 
email through the Internet. Here is a random selection: 

Network-wide ID  Full address      List title
---------------  ------------      ----------
AESRG-L          AESRG-L@UMCVMB    Applied Expert Systems Research Group List
AGRIC-L          AGRIC-L@UGA       Agriculture Discussion
AIDSNEWS         AIDSNEWS@EB0UB011 AIDS/HIV News
ANIME-L          ANIME-L@VTVM1     Japanese animedia and other animation news.
BANYAN           BANYAN-L@AKRONVM  Banyan Networks Discussion List
BRIDGE           BRIDGE@NDSUVM1    Bridge Communication products
CHEM-L           CHEM-L@UOGUELPH   Chemistry discussion
EJCREC           EJCREC@RPIECS     Electronic Journal of Communication
FAMCOMM          FAMCOMM@RPICICGE  Marital/family & relational communication
SOVNET-L         SOVNET-L@INDYCMS  USSR electronic communication list

The column "Network-wide ID" contains the names of the mailing 
lists. "Full address" contains their BITNET email addresses. "List 
title" is a short textual description of each conference. 
    Keep the list on your hard disk. This makes it easier to find 
sources of information, when you need them. 

Subscribing to mailing lists
----------------------------
Each line in the list above refers to a mailing list, also often 
called 'discussion list'. They work like online conferences or 
message sections on bulletin boards, but technically they are
different. (Read about KIDLINK in Chapter 2 for background 
information.) 
    All BITNET mailing lists are controlled by a program called 
LISTSERV on the host computer given in column two above (for 
example @UMCVMB). They offer "conferencing" with the following 
important functions: 

    * All "discussion items" (i.e., electronic messages sent to the
      lists' email address) are distributed to all subscribers.
    * All messages are automatically stored in notebook archives.
      You can search these log files, and you can have them sent
      to you as electronic mail.
    * Files can be stored in the lists' associated file libraries
      for distribution to subscribers on demand.

Where to send a subscription request, depends on where you are 
communicating from relative to the host running the LISTSERV. If 
this host is your nearest BITNET LISTSERV, then send the request
to the address in column two by replacing the list name by LISTSERV. 

    Example:
    AESRG-L@UMCVMB is administered by LISTSERV@UMCVMB. Subscribe
    (or signoff) by email to LISTSERV@UMCVMB.BITNET . 

If there is a LISTSERV closer to where you live, then you should 
subscribe to the nearby system rather than to the remote. This 
helps keep the total costs of the international network down. 

    Example:
    You live in Norway. The nearest LISTSERV is at FINHUTC. To
    subscribe to AESRG-L@UMCVMB, send to LISTSERV@FINHUTC.BITNET . 

Use the addresses in column two when sending messages to the other 
members of the discussion lists, but do NOT send your subscription 
requests to this address!! If you do, it will be forwarded to all 
members of the mailing list. Chances are that nothing will happen, 
and everybody will see how sloppy you are. 
    So, you subscribe by sending a command to a LISTSERV. The 
method is similar to what we did when subscribing to Infonets in 
Chapter 7. If your name is Jens Jensen, and you want to subscribe 
to SOVNET-L, send this message through the Internet (assuming that 
NDSUM1 is your nearest LISTSERV host): 

    To:  LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.BITNET
    Subject: (You can write anything here. Will be ignored.)
    Text: SUB SOVNET-L Jens Jensen

When your subscription has been registered, you will receive a 
confirmation. From this date, all messages sent to the list will be 
forwarded to your mailbox. (Send "SIGNOFF SOVNET-L" to this address,
when you have had enough.) 
   Some lists will forward each message to you upon receipt. Others 
will send a periodic digest (weekly, monthly, etc.). 
    To send a message to SOVNET-L, send to the BITNET address in 
column two above. Send to 

    SOVNET-L@INDYCMS.BITNET

Review the following example. Most BITNET lists will accept these 
commands. 

Example: Subscription to the China list
---------------------------------------
CHINA-NN is listed like this in the List of Lists: 

    CHINA-NN   CHINA-NN@ASUACAD  China News Digest (Global News)

Scandinavians may subscribe to CHINA-NN by Internet mail to 
LISTSERV@FINHUTC.BITNET . North American users may send their mail 
to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.BITNET . 
    If your name is Winston Hansen, write the following command in the
TEXT of the message

    SUB CHINA-NN Winston Hansen 

When you want to leave CHINA-NN, send a cancellation message like 
this: 

    To: LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.BITNET
    Subject: (nothing here)
    SIGNOFF CHINA-NN

NOTE: Send the cancellation command to the address you used, when 
subscribing! If you subscribed through LISTSERV@FINHUTC, sending 
the SIGNOFF command to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1 will get you nowhere. Send 
to LISTSERV@FINHUTC.
    Never send the SIGNOFF command to the discussion list itself! 
Always send to the LISTSERV. 

Monitoring the action
---------------------
THINKNET is an online magazine forum dedicated to "thoughtfulness in 
the cybertime environment." It brings reviews of significant and 
thought-provoking exchanges within our new electronic nation. 
    This electronic publication is free. If you're interested in 
philosophy, subscribe by sending a message through Internet to 
thinknet@world.std.com . Write the following in the TEXT of the 
message: 

SEND THINKNET TO Your-Full-Name AT UserId@Your-Internet-Email-Address

    Example:
    If your email address is opresno@extern.uio.no and your name 
    Odd de Presno, use the following command: 

      SEND THINKNET TO Odd de Presno AT OPRESNO@EXTERN.UIO.NO 

THINKNET is also available through the Philosophy conference on The 
Well, and on GEnie in the Philosophy category under the Religion 
and Ethics Bulletin Board. (Hard copy versions can be bought 
through THINKNET, PO BOX 8383, Orange CA 92664-8383, U.S.A.).

             with utilities and software related to the Internet 
             and BITNET networks. The library contains several good
             help files for novice networkers. A great place for
             new Internet users!

How to get more out of your magazine subscriptions 
--------------------------------------------------
PC Magazine (U.S.A.) is one of those magazines that arrives here by 
mail. We butcher them, whenever we find something of interest. The 
"corpses" are dumped in a high pile on the floor. 
    To retrieve a story in this pile is difficult and time 
consuming, unless the title is printed on the cover. 
    Luckily, there are shortcuts. Logon to PC MagNet on CompuServe. 
Type GO PCMAG to get the following menu:

Choice six lets you search for stories. Once you have a list with 
page/issue references, turning the pages gets much easier. 
    PC Magazine is owned by the media giant Ziff-Davis. PC MagNet 
is a part of ZiffNet on CompuServe. So is Computer Database Plus, 
which lets you search through more than 250,000 articles from over 
200 popular newspapers and magazines. The oldest articles are from 
early 1987. The database is also available on CD-ROM, but the discs 
cover only one year at a time. 
    CDP contains full-text from around 50 magazines, like Personal 
Computing, Electronic News, MacWeek and Electronic Business. 
Stories from the other magazines are available in abstracted form 
only. 
    To search the database, CDP, you pay an extra US$24.00 per 
hour. In addition, you pay US$1.00 per abstract and US$1.50 per 
full-text article (1992). These fees are added to your normal 
CompuServe access rates. 
    ZiffNet also offers Magazine Database Plus, a database with 
stories from over 90 magazines covering science, business, sport, 
people, personal finance, family, art and handicraft, cooking, 
education, environment, travel, politics, consumer opinions, and 
reviews of books and films. 
    The magazines include: Administrative Management, Aging, 
Changing Times, The Atlantic, Canadian Business, Datamation, 
Cosmopolitan, Dun's Business Month, The Economist, The Futurist, 
High Technology Business, Journal of Small Business Management, 
Management Today, The Nation, The New Republic, Online, Playboy, 
Inc., Popular Science, Research & Development, Sales & Marketing 
Management, Scientific American, Technology Review, UN Chronicle, 
UNESCO Courier and U.S. News & World Report. 
    In the next chapter, we will present another ZiffNet magazine 
database: the Business Database Plus. 
    Magazine Index (MI), from Information Access Company (U.S.A.), 
is another source worth looking at. It covers over 500 consumer and 
general-interest periodicals as diverse as Special Libraries and 
Sky & Telescope, Motor Trend and Modern Maturity, Reader's Digest 
and Rolling Stone. Many titles go as far back as 1959. 
    Although most of the database consists of brief citations, MI 
also contains the complete text of selected stories from a long 
list of periodicals. It is available through Dialog, CompuServe, 
BRS, Data-Star, Dow Jones News/Retrieval, Nexis, and others. 
    Say you so often get references to a given magazine that you 
want a paper subscription. Try the Electronic Newsstand, which is 
available by gopher or telnet to gopher.netsys.com. If these 
Internet commands are unavailable, try mail to staff@enews.com. 

Finding that book
-----------------
Over 270 libraries around the world are accessible by the Internet 
telnet command. Some of them can also be accessed by Internet mail.
This is the case with BIBSYS, a database operated by the Norwegian 
universities' libraries. 
    I am into transcendental meditation. I'm therefore constantly 
looking for books on narrow topics like "mantra". To search BIBSYS 
for titles of interest, I sent mail to genserv@pollux.bibsys.no . 
The search word was entered in the subject title of the message. By 
return email, I got the following report:

    On the Internet, there are a rapidly growing number of library 
online public-access catalogs (OPACs) from all over the world. Some 
provide users with access to additional resources, such as 
periodical indexes of specialized databases. More than 270 library 
catalogs are now online (1992). 
    An up-to-date directory of libraries that are interactively 
accessible through Internet can be had by anonymous ftp from 
ftp.unt.edu (then: cd library). File name: LIBRARIES.TXT. Check out 
the end of Chapter 12 for how to get the file by email (ftpmail). 
    You will also find full electronic versions of books. This book 
is one example. Many texts are courtesy of Project Gutenberg, an

Chapter 11: Getting an edge over your competitor
================================================


    We must be willing to risk change to keep apace with rapid 
    change. 

    The key is moderation and balance, supported by sufficient 
    information to allow meaningful feedback. 

    It requires adaption by management and staff in developing 
    the necessary skills and vision.

This chapter starts with how to use the networks to manage 
projects. Next, it treats how to monitor competitors, prospects, 
suppliers, markets, technologies, and trends. It winds down with 
marketing and sales by modem. 

Project coordination
--------------------
So far we have mainly been looking at sources of information. Let 
us start this chapter with some words about 'online conference 
rooms' for project coordination. 
    Several services offer rental of private conference areas to 
businesses. Corporations have discovered them to be an efficient 
way of coordinating a group of people, who are far apart from each 
other geographically. They are also useful when team members are 
constantly on the move and hard to gather face to face. 
    Many international companies use such services regularly. The 
applications are different. They range from tight coordination with 
suppliers and subcontractors, to development of company strategies 
and new organizational structures. 
    Renting an online conference room has advantages over doing it 
in-house. The company does not have to buy software, hardware, 
expensive equipment for communications, and hire people for to run 
and maintain a conferencing system. The more international the 
business, the better. 
    For ideas about how to set up and operate a coordination 
conference. Study how volunteer organizations do it. One place to 
check out is KIDPLAN, one of several coordination conferences used 
by KIDLINK (see Chapter 2 and 5). 
    KIDPLAN is usually most active during April and May each year. 
This is when their annual projects are being closed down, and new 
projects are started. Read the dialog between coordinators to get 
an idea of how the medium is being used. 
    Old conference messages are stored in notebook files. You can 
therefore have the full coordination dialogs sent you by email. 
Send all requests for notebook files to 

    LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU

Getting notebook files is a two-step process. In your first message 
to the LISTSERV, ask for a list of available files. Do this by 
using the following command in your email: 

    INDEX KIDPLAN

The LISTSERV will return a list of files. The following part is of 
particular interest: 

101/2/  KIDPLAN  LOG9105B   ALL OWN V      80  2397 91/05/14 
    23:40:22 Started on Wed, 8 May 91 00:11:09 CDT
102/2/  KIDPLAN  LOG9105C   ALL OWN V      80  3141 91/05/21 
    20:44:16 Started on Wed, 15 May 91 01:24:51 CDT
104/2/  KIDPLAN  LOG9105D   ALL OWN V      80  2685 91/05/28 
    22:34:31 Started on Wed, 22 May 91 17:01:21 +0200

Don't bother about the details. You just want file names, and 
dates. The file LOG9105B contains all messages from 8 May 1991 
until 15 May. 
    If you want all these three files, send another message to 
LISTSERV with the following lines: 

    GET KIDPLAN LOG9105B
    GET KIDPLAN LOG9105C
    GET KIDPLAN LOG9105D

The files will be forwarded to your mailbox. 
    Note: Some mailbox services have restrictions on the size of 
incoming mail. This may prevent you from receiving large notebook 
files. If this happens, contact your local postmaster for help. 
    Some email systems are unable to forward your return-address 
correctly to LISTSERV. If you suspect that this is the reason for 
lack of success, try the following commands: 

    GIVE KIDPLAN LOG9105B TO Your-Correct-Return-Address
    GIVE KIDPLAN LOG9105C TO Your-Correct-Return-Address
    GIVE KIDPLAN LOG9105D TO Your-Correct-Return-Address

Making it work
--------------
Making online conferences and task force meetings work, can be a 
challenge. Most of the dialog is based on the written word. The 
flow of information can be substantial thus causing an information 
overload for some participants. 
    To overcome this, many companies appoint moderator-organizers 
for their online conferences. This person: 

  Adds value by setting agendas; summarizing points; getting
  the discussion(s) back on track; moving on to the next
  point; mediating debate; maintaining address and member
  lists; acting as general sparkplug/motivator to keep things
  flowing by making sure that contributions are acknowledged,
  relevant points are noted, new members are welcomed, silent
  "Read-Only Members" are encouraged to participate, and the
  general atmosphere is kept appropriate to the goals of the
  conference/task force meeting.

Great online conferences don't just happen. Hard work is required. 
A few people must be responsible for getting the meetings fired up 
and keep the discussion rolling. 
    The meeting's organization may depend on the number of 
participants, where they come from, the exclusivity of the forum, 
and the purpose of the "meeting." 
    In large meetings, with free access for outsiders, the best 
strategy may be to appoint a Moderator-Editor. This person 

  Filters contributions, gathers new information, summarizes
  scattered contributions, does background research. 

Filtering may be needed in conferences that are open to customers 
and media. The main purpose, however, is to help participants cope 
with the absolute flow of information. 
    A conference can have an educational purpose. If so, you may 
bring in someone who can add value by bringing experience and 
expertise to the group. 
    You will also need someone to do all the dirty jobs everyone 
expects to be done - but never notices until they are not done. 
This person must keep the show running by serving as a benevolent 
tyrant, sheriff, judge, mediator, general scapegoat, and by playing 
a role in setting the general policy and atmosphere of the meeting.
    Now, back to the 'normal' applications of the online resource.

Monitoring what others do
-------------------------
The best business opportunities are outside your company, in the 
external world. We need to monitor customers and markets, find 
technologies to help develop and build products, research new 
business actions, find new subcontractors and suppliers, people to 
hire, and persons to influence to boost sales. 
    In this marketing age, where sales calls cost hundreds of 
dollars and business-to-business marketers use the telephone or 
the mails to reach prospects, complete and accurate market lists 
are most valuable commodities.
    There are many other questions: What are our most important 
customers and their key people doing? What new products are they 
promoting? Who are their joint-venture partners? What else may 
influence their willingness to buy from us? 
    What prices are our major suppliers offering other buyers? 
Should we get other sources for supplies? What major contracts have 
they received recently? Will these influence their ability to serve 
our needs? 
    What new technologies are available now and how are they being 
used by others?
    Threats are the reverse side of opportunities. What are our 
competitors doing? What products and services have they launched 
recently? Are they successful? What are our competitors' weaknesses 
and strengths? What relationships do they maintain with our most 
important customers? How is their customer support functioning, and 
what methods are they using in their quality assurance? 
    Each company has its own priorities when it comes to watching 
the external environment. The information needs are different from 
company to company, depending on what products and services that 
are offered, the technological level of the company, the markets 
that they address, and more. 
    Needs and priorities also differ by department and person, for 
example depending on whether a user is the president, a marketing 
manager, product manager, sales man, or has a position in finance 
or production. 
    Remember your priorities when going online to search. You 
cannot possibly capture and digest all information that is there.
Your basic problem remains to find the right information in the 
right form at the right time. 

Build your own, local 'database'
--------------------------------
It does not take much effort to check one hundred different topics 
from multiple online sources on a daily basis. The computer will do 
it for you. 
    Also, you do not have to read all stories as carefully as you 
would with printed material. Most experienced users just read what 
is important now, and save selected parts of the retrieved texts on 
their hard disks for later reference. 
    We handle printed material differently. Most of us make notes 
in the margins, underline, use colors, cut out pages and put into 
folders. These tricks are important, since it is so hard to find 
information in a pile of papers. 
    Not so with electronic information. With the right tools, you 
can locate information on your computer's hard disk in seconds. 
    In seven seconds, I just searched the equivalent of 2000 pages 
of printed text for all occurrences of the combined search words 
'SONY' and 'CD-ROM'! 
    My tool was the shareware program LOOKFOR (see Chapter 14). It 
searched through 4.2 megabyte on my 80486-based notebook computer. 
If you use an indexing program, the search may be completed even 
faster. 
    I guess you can see it coming. My personal databases usually 
give more direct value during my working day, than what I have on 
paper, and have available online. 
    My hard disks contain megabytes of texts retrieved from various 
online services, but only what I have decided to keep. This private 
database therefore contains more relevant information per kilobyte 
than the online databases I'm using. Searching the data often gives 
enough good hits to keep me from going online for more. 

  | I repeat: You will often get better results when searching your |
  | own subset of selected online databases, than by going online   |
  | to get information. It is usually easier and faster.            |

On the other hand, your in-house database will never be fully up-
to-date. Too many things happen all the time. 
    Also, the search terms used for your daily intake of news will 
never cover all future needs. Occasionally, you must go online to 
get additional information for a project, a report, a plan. 
    Updating your database means going online often to find new 
supplementary information. 

  | Regular monitoring gives the highest returns, and is required |
  | if you want to have an edge over your competitors.            |

For beginners, the best strategy will often be to start with the 
general, and gradually dig deeper into industry specific details. 
Let us now review some good hunting grounds for information, and 
how to use them. 

Clipping the news
-----------------
Several online services offer 'clipping services'. They select the 
news that you want - 24 hours a day - from a continuous stream of 
stories from newspapers, magazines, news agencies and newsletters. 
    Several services make news immediately available, when they 
have been received by satellite. The delay previously used to 
protect the interests of print media is disappearing quickly. 
Online services usually deliver news sooner than in print media, 
radio or TV. 
    You select stories by giving the online service a set of search 
terms. The hits are then sent to your electronic mailbox, for you 
to retrieve at will. 
    'Clipping' gives an enormous advantage. Few important details 
escape your attention, even when you cannot go online daily. The 
stories will stay in your mailbox until you have read them. 

'Clipping' on CompuServe
------------------------
CompuServe's Executive News Service (ENS) monitor more than 8,000 
stories daily. They use sources like Deutsche Press-Agentur, Kyodo 
News Service, TASS, Xinhua News Agency, the Washington Post, OTC 
News-Alert, Reuters Financial News Wire, Associated Press, UPI and 
Reuters World Report, IDG PR Service, Inter Press Service (IPS), 
Middle East News Network and European Community Report. 
    One of them, Reuters, has 1,200 journalists in 120 bureaus all 
over the world. They write company news reports about revenue, 
profit, dividend, purchases of other companies, changes in 
management, and other important items for judging a company's 
results. They write regular opinions about Industry, Governments, 
Economics, Leading indicators, and Commerce. 
    Reuters also offers full-text stories from Financial Times and 
other leading European newspapers. Its Textline is a database with 
news from some 1,500 publications in over 40 countries. It includes 
Reuters' own news services, and has translated abstracts of stories
from some 17 languages. The database reaches back 10 years and is 
updated at around one million articles per year. (Textline is also 
available on Nexis, Data-Star, and Dialog.) 
    Another one, the IDG PR Service, sends out high-tech related 
news gathered by the staffs of IDG's magazines.  InterPress Service 
covers Third World countries. Middle East News Network integrates 
the contents of 28 information sources covering this region of the 
world. 
    The Executive News Service lets you define up to three 
'clipping folders'. Supply up to seven 'key phrases' that define 
your interests. These key phrases will be used when searching 
stories as they are sent. Hits will be 'clipped' and held in a 
folder for you to review at your convenience. 
    Each folder can hold 500 stories. When creating a clipping 
folder, you set an expiration date and specify how many days a 
clipped story is to be held (maximum 14 days). 
    To browse the contents of a folder, select it from the menu. 
Stories can be listed by headlines or leads. Select those you want 
to read, forward to others as email, or copy to another folder. 
Delete those that you do not need. 
    Defining key phrases is simple. The important thing is not to 
get too much nor too little. General phrases will give you many 
unwanted stories while too narrow phrases will cause you to miss 
pertinent stories. Let me illustrate with an example: 

    The phrase APPLE COMPUTERS will only clip stories that have the
    words APPLE and COMPUTERS next to each other. This may be too 
    narrow. Specifying just APPLE or just COMPUTERS would be too
    broad. Entering APPLE + COMPUTERS is a better phrase since the
    words can appear anywhere in the story, and not necessarily 
    next to each other. 

ENS carries an hourly surcharge of US$15/hour over base connect 
rates.

NewsNet's clipping service, NewsFlash, will automatically search 
all new editions of newsletters selected for monitoring. The hits 
will be sent to your mailbox, and be retained there for up to ten 
weeks besides the current week. 
    Your selection of newsletters can be extended to include news 
stories from United Press International (UPI), Reuters News Reports, 
Associated Press, Business Wire, PR Newswire, and others. 
    For some time, I clipped newsletters in the telecommunications 
group using the keywords  'Victoria' (an American communication 
project) and 'KDD' (the Japanese telecom giant). When I called 
NewsFlash to check, it typically reported:

NewsNet's databases grow by more than 400 stories per day. Your 
search profiles may contain an almost unlimited number of subjects. 
Delivery of hits is concurrent. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days 
a week. 
    Sprintmail's clipping service (U.S.A.) scans stories from more 
than 15 international newswires. FT Profile's E-mail Alert searches 
daily on that particular day's issue of the Financial Times. 
    Dow Jones News/Retrieval has NewsScan (//CLIP). It can deliver 
by fax or email to a mailbox on another online service. On GEnie, 
use QuikNews Express, a personalized news clipping service that is 
integrated with the Quik-Comm System email service. 
    Clarinet, a commercial news service available through Usenet, 
also has a clipping program. 

When clipping is impossible
---------------------------
Many services do not offer clipping. Here, your alternative is 
various methods of regular selective reading. 
    Many conferencing systems let you select messages by keywords. 
BIX has Keyword Indexer. It let you search public conferences after 
a key word or phrase and report hits. Then it offers you to review 
(or retrieve) messages of interest. 
    CompuServe's forums have efficient 'read selective' and 'quick 
scan' commands. Another trick is to limit your reading to specific 
message sections. 
    The high forum message volume is a special problem on this 
service. Old messages are regularly deleted to make room for new 
ones. (Often called "scroll rate.") Some popular forums do not keep 
messages for more than a couple of days before letting them go. You 
must visit often to get all new information. 
    Many bulletin boards can be told to store unread messages about 
given topics in a compressed transportation file. This file can 
then be retrieved at high speed. Special communication programs 
(often called offline readers) and commands are available to 
automate this completely. 
    Powerful scripts (see Chapter 12) can do automatic selection of 
news stories based on the occurrence of keywords (e.g., a company 
name) in headlines. I have developed such a system for selecting 
news from the Online Today magazine on CompuServe. 

Subscription services
---------------------
It is useful to dig, dig, and dig for occurrences of the same 
search words, but digging is not enough. Unless you periodically 
scan "the horizon," you risk missing new trends, viewpoints and 
other important information. 
    It can be difficult to find good sources of information that 
suits your needs. One trick is to watch the reports from your 
clipping services. Over time, you may discover that some sources 
bring more interesting stories than others. Take a closer look at 
these. Consider browsing their full index of stories regularly. 
    If your company plans exportation to countries in Asia, check 
out MARKET: ASIA PACIFIC on NewsNet. The newsletter is published 
monthly by W-Two Publications, Ltd., 202 The Commons, Suite 401, 
Ithaca, NY  14850, U.S.A. (phone: +1-607-277-0934). Annual print
subscription rate: US$279. 
    The index itself may be a barometer of what goes on. Here is an 
example. Note the number of Words/Lines. Do these numbers tell a 
story?

It is a good idea to visit NewsNet to gather intelligence. Review
indexes of potentially interesting newsletters. Save them on your 
hard disk for future references. You never know when they may be of 
use. 
    The newsletters within computers and electronics bring 
forecasts of market trends, evaluation of hardware and software, 
prices, information about IBM and other leading companies. You will

    The Management section contains experts' evaluation of the 
economical climate with forecasts, information about foreign 
producers for importers, tips and experiences on personal 
efficiency, management of smaller companies, and office automation.

libraries on CompuServe. Consequently, they are a little harder 
to locate. Some examples (1993): 

    Abacus Online - Quarterly newsletter on executive computing.

    Anime Stuff - News and reviews of Japanese animation software.
    (Comics/Animation Forum, Library 5.)

IBMFF to search. Select "Keyword" as search criteria, and enter 
"newsletter". Add further keywords to narrow the search to your 
areas of interest. CompuServe also has other file find services.

Most countries have several local language news services. In 
Norway, Statens Datasentral lets you search stories from the NTB 
news agency. Aftenposten, a major newspaper, offers full-text 
stories from their A-TEKST database, from Dagens Naeringsliv (DNX), 
and the Kapital magazine. 
    Before meeting with people from Norsk Hydro, go online to get 
recent news about these companies. It will only take a couple of 
minutes. What you find may be important for the success of your 
meeting. 
    If you know the names of your most important competitors, use 
their names as keywords for information about recent contracts, 
joint venture agreements, products (and their features), and other 
important information. 
    KOMPASS ONLINE offers information about over 180,000 companies 
and 34,000 products in Scandinavia, Finland, Germany, Switzerland,

    The TYR database on the Finnish service VIEXPO (tel.: +358 67 
235100) offers information about 2,500 companies in the Vaasa and 
Oulu regions with addresses, phone numbers, contact persons, main 
products, revenues, and SIC industry classification codes. 
    We can go on like this. The list of available services is long 
in many countries.

How to monitor your competitors
-------------------------------
Sales managers need to know what competitors are doing. Lacking 
this knowledge, it is risky to maneuver in the market. 
   Start by making a strategy for online market intelligence. Here 
are some practical hints: 

(1) Select online services that offer clipping of stories and 
    information based on your search words or phrases. Examples: 
    NewsFlash on NewsNet, //TRACK on Dow Jones News/Retrieval, The 
    Executive News Service on CompuServe. Use these services for 
    automatic monitoring of stock quotes and business news. 

(2) Read what investment analysts and advisors write about your 
    competitors. Most markets are well covered by databases and 
    other sources of information. 

(3) Read what competitors write about themselves. Their press 
    releases are available from online databases in several 
    countries. 

(4) Compare your competitors with your own company and industry. 
    Items: stock prices, profits, revenue, etc. 

(5) Regularly monitor companies and their particular products. 

(6) Watch trend reports about your industry. Search for patterns and 
    possible niches. 

(7) Save what you find on your hard disk for future references. 

Can you get everything through the online medium? Of course not! 
Don't expect to find production data, production formulas, detailed 
outlines of a company's pension plan, or the number of personal 
computers in a company. Such information rarely finds its way to 
public databases. 

Intelligence by fax
-------------------
Financial Times' Profile has Fax Alert. Predefine your interests 
using search words. Stories will be cut and sent to your personal 
fax number whenever they appear. Price depends on the number of 
characters transmitted. 
    Other online services offer similar services. 

The Bulletin Board as a sales tool
----------------------------------
Many companies - large and small - use bulletin board systems as a 
marketing instrument. Here is an example: 
    The San Francisco-based Compact Disk Exchange (Tel.: +1-415-824-
7603) offers a database of used CD records. Members can call in to 
buy at very low prices. They can sell old CDs through the board or 
buy from other members. (1992)

Marketing and sales by modem
----------------------------
The Americans have a gift for this. You meet them in online forums 
all over the world, in person or through agents, and especially in 
computer oriented conferences and clubs. 
    Their main strategy is reference selling. Make key customers 
happy, and make sure they tell others.
    In Chapter 5, I told you what happened when a member wrote 
about his upgrade to a 425 megabytes hard disk in CompuServe's 
Toshiba forum. It made me place my order with his preferred seller. 
    One common sales strategy is to be constantly present in 
relevant conferences, and spend a generous amount of time helping 
others. This takes time. By proving competence and willingness to 
help, you build a positive personal profile. This profile is the 
key to business, information about competitors and other benefits. 
    To drop quickly into a conference to post an "advertisement," 
is a waste of time. The message may be read by some, but chances 
are that you will be criticized (in public) for having 'polluted 
their environment' with a commercial message. 
    Besides, the volume of information in the best conferences for 
your marketing effort is probably too high to make traditional 
advertisements worth the while. 

Electronic mail
---------------
Here is a list of other useful applications of electronic mail: 

    * to distribute quickly lists of important prospects to your 
      sales force,
    * to avoid lengthy telephone conversations,
    * to receive order information faster and more efficiently than
      by traditional mail or fax,
    * to distribute quickly reports and memos to key people all
      over the world,
    * to send new prices and product announcements to customers,
    * to exchange spread sheets and analyses between users of
      personal computers.

If this isn't enough, ask for information from the International 
Business Network at 70724.311@compuserve.com (or, at 70724,311 on 
CompuServe). 

Chapter 12: Practical tips
==========================

- Quick transfers with a minimum of errors
- Rescuing lost files
- Copyright and other legal matters
- Unwritten laws about personal conduct
- Privacy 
- Fax services weigh less than your printer
- File transfers through the Internet

Speed and safety
----------------
Read about MNP, CCITT V.42, and V.42bis in appendix 2. These are 
popular methods for automatic error correction and compression of 
data. Compression gives faster transfers of data. 
    To use them, your modem must have these features built-in. They 
must also be enabled in the modem of the service that you are 
calling. 
    Compression is particularly helpful when sending or receiving 
text, for example news stories and messages in conferences. They 
ensure faster transfers. 
    They are not of much help when transferring precompressed texts 
and programs. They may even make file transfers with protocols like 
ZMODEM, Kermit, and XMODEM impossible. If this happens, temporarily 
turn off the MNP and V.24/V42bis settings in your modem (more about 
this in appendix 2). 
    Some online services let users retrieve conference messages 
using a special get or grab function. This function often comes in 
two versions: 
    * Grab to display: New messages and conference items are 
received in an uninterrupted stream without stops between items. 
Retrieval of text can happen at maximum speed. 
    * Grab to compressed file: New messages and conference items 
are selected, automatically compressed and stored in a file. This 
file is then transferred using ZMODEM or similar protocols. 
    Some services offer unattended online work with a variation of 
the "get compressed file" method. Read about 'offline readers' in 
chapter 16 for more about this. 
    The more advanced your software is, the more time it will take 
to learn how to use it. The rewards are lower telephone costs, 
faster transfers, and less time spent doing technical online work. 
    Recommended. 

Different needs, different solutions
------------------------------------
Frank Burns of the American online service MetaNet is spokesperson 
for the strategy SCAN - FOCUS - ACT. 
    On your first visits to a new online service, you SCAN. The 
goal is to get an overview of what is being offered and find out 
how to use it most efficiently. Notes are made of interesting 
bulletins, databases, conferences, messages, news services, public 
domain and shareware programs, games, and more. 
    Capture all of it to disk. Don't study it until disconnected 
from the service. Evaluate the material to prepare for your next 
moves: FOCUS and ACT. 
    As you learn about offerings, users and applications, your use 
of the service changes. What was interesting on your first visits, 
lose out to new discoveries. Some applications may stay as 'regular 
online functions', like when you decide to read a given news report 
on Monday mornings. 
    Here are some other hints:

    * Find out what you do NOT have to know and have enough self- 
confidence immediately to discard irrelevant material. Walk quickly 
through the information. Select what you need now, store other 
interesting items on your hard disk, clip references, and drop the 
remainder of your capture file. 

    * Learn when and how to use people, computers, libraries and 
other resources. Prepare well before going online. Note that the 
online resource may not necessarily be the quickest way to the 
goal. If you want the name of Michael Jackson's latest album, you 
may get a faster answer by calling a local music shop. . . .

    * Make an outline of how to search the service before going 
online. If required, start by going online to collect help menus 
and lists of search commands (unless you already have the printed 
user information manual). Study the instructions carefully, plan 
your visit, and then call back. 
    Often, it may be useful to do trial searches in online data, 
which you have previously captured to your hard disk. Do this to 
check if your use of search words is sensible. 
    Who knows, you may even have what you are searching for right 
there.  Besides, it is imperative that you use the correct search 
terms to find what you're looking for. 
    Write your search strategy on a piece of paper. If you know how 
to write macros for your communications program, consider writing 
some for your planned search commands. - Few people can type 240 
characters per second. Using macros may save you time, frustration 
and money. 

    * It may be wise to do your search in two steps. On your first 
visit: Get a LIST of selected headlines or references, and then log 
off the service. 
    Study your finds, and plan the next step. Then call back to get 
full-text of the most promising stories. 
    This strategy is often better than just 'hanging online' while 
thinking. When you feel the pressure of the taximeter, it is easy 
to make costly mistakes. 

    * Novices should always go the easiest way. Don't be shy. Ask 
SOS Assistance services for help, if available. Invest in special 
communication programs with built in automatic online searching 
features. They are designed to make your work easier. 

    * Limit your search and avoid general and broad search terms. 
It is often wise to start with a search word that is so 'narrow' 
that it is unlikely to find articles outside your area of interest. 
Your goal is not to find many stories. You want the right ones. 

When everything fails
---------------------
Data communications is simple - when you master it. Occasionally, 
however, you WILL lose data. You may even experience the worst of 
all: losing unread private email on your hard disk. 
    A while ago, this happened to a friend. She logged on to her 
mailbox service using the communications program Procomm. 
    After capturing all her mail, she tried to send a message. For 
some reason, the computer just froze. It was impossible to close 
the capture file. She had to switch the power OFF/ON to continue. 
All retrieved mail was obviously lost. 
    The other day, I had a similar experience. After having written 
a long and difficult letter, something went wrong. The outfile was 
inexplicably closed. The resulting file size was 0 bytes. 
    Both problems were solved by the MS-DOS program CHKDSK run with 
the /F option. If you ever get this problem, and have an MS-DOS 
computer, try it. It may save your day. 

Copyright notices and legal stuff
---------------------------------
Most commercial online services protect their offerings with 
copyright notices. This is especially so for database information 
and news. 
    Some vendors make you accept in writing not to store captured 
data on a local media (like diskettes or hard disks). Others (like 
Prodigy in the U.S.) force clients to use communication software
that makes it impossible to store incoming data to disk. 
    The reason is simple. Information providers want to protect 
their income. 
    In most countries, you can quote from what others have written. 
You can cut pieces out of a whole and use in your own writing. What 
you cannot do, however, is copy news raw to resell to others. If 
an online service discovers you doing that, expect a law suit. 
    Read copyright notices to learn about the limitations on your 
usage of data that you receive. 

Unwritten laws about personal conduct
-------------------------------------
Some services let their users be anonymous. This is the case on 
many chat services. If you want to pose as Donald Duck or Jack the 
Ripper, just do that. 
    Many free BBS systems let you register for full access to the 
service during your first visit. It is possible to use any name. 
Don't do that. Use your true name, unless asked to do otherwise. 
It's impolite and unrespectful of the other members to participate 
in online discussions using a false identity. 
    Being helpful is an important aspect of the online world. The 
people you meet 'there' use of their time to help you and others. 
Often free. The atmosphere is one of gratitude, and a positive 
attitude toward all members. 
    If you use rude words in public, expect your mailbox to fill 
with angry messages from others. Those who respond carefully to 
personal attacks, will never regret it. Don't say things online 
that you would not have said in person. 
    REMEMBER: Words written in a moment of anger or frustration 
can be stored on at least one hard disk. Your 'sins' may stay 
there for a long time - to resurface when you least want it to. 
    Here are some guidelines (often called 'online netiquette'): 

    * If mail to a person doesn't make it through, avoid posting
      the message to a conference. Keep private messages private.

    * It is considered extremely bad taste to post private mail
      from someone else on public conferences, unless they give 
      you explicit permission to redistribute it. 

    * Many users end their messages with some lines about how
      to get in touch with them  (their email address, phone
      number, address, etc.). Limit your personal "signature"
      to maximum four lines.

    * Do not send test messages to a public conference, unless
      they are set up to serve this purpose.

    * If someone requests that readers reply by private email,
      do that. Do not send to the conference, where the request 
      appeared. 

    * When replying to a message in a public conference, many
      users 'quote' the original message prefixed by '>' or
      another special character, as in

         You wrote:
         >I strongly believe it was wrong to attack
         >Fidel Castro in this way!

     When you quote another person, edit out whatever isn't
     directly applicable to your reply. By including the entire
     message, you'll only annoy those reading it.

   * Note that if you USE ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, people will
     think you're shouting.

Finally, smile with me about the following story: According to Time 
magazine (7/19/93, p. 58), three women who corresponded with Mr. X 
over the network discovered his duplicity and went public on the 
network. The incident sparked a lively debate over electronic 
etiquette (and ruined Mr. Casanova's chances for further romance). 

Fax services weigh less than your computer's printer
----------------------------------------------------
Many online services let you send electronic mail as fax messages. 
This is an interesting feature when in that far away place without 
a printer. Send the draft contract or other texts to your hotel's 
fax machine or to your client's office to get a printout on paper. 

Privacy
-------
The level of online privacy differs by network, service, and 
application. Whatever these services may claim, always expect that 
someone, somewhere, is able to watch, even record. 
    All mailbox services have at least one person authorized to 
access your personal mail box in case of an emergency. Most of the 
time they not have a right to read it without your permission, but 
they can. 
    In some countries, mailbox services may let outsiders (like the 
police) routinely read your private email to check for 'illegal' 
contents. In this respect, email is not safer than ordinary mail. 
    The good news is that most 'inspectors' and 'sysops' are good, 
honest people. On the other hand, it is useful to know your 
situation. 
    It is not safe to send sensitive information (like credit card 
details) by private electronic mail. True, the probability that an
outsider should get hold of and take advantage of such information 
is small, but it definitely is not 100 percent safe. 

    Encrypt your email to protect sensitive information. 

Always assume that someone is recording all that is being said in 
online conferences, chats, and other interactive social gatherings. 
In chats, anyone using a personal computer as a terminal can log 
the conversation, or use screen dump just to capture 'interesting 
parts'. 
    Many PC users can scroll back the screen. They can wait and 
decide whether to save the conversation in a file until after the 
conversation has taken place. With these capabilities widely 
available, users of chats and talk should always assume that their 
conversations are being recorded.
    Do not say indiscreet things in small, informal discussions. It  
may be recorded and reposted under embarrassing circumstances. 
    The program PGP has become the defacto international Internet 
standard for public key encryption.
    For more on privacy, check out ETHICS-L@MARIST.BITNET. The 
files RFC 1113 through 1115 are about 'Privacy enhancements for 
Internet electronic mail' (see appendix 1 for how to get them). 
    Usenet has alt.privacy (Privacy issues in cyberspace), and 
comp.society.privacy (Effects of technology on privacy). 

File transfers through the Internet
-----------------------------------
The Internet is a term used of a network interconnecting hundreds 
of thousands of computer centers around the world. These centers 
use different types of hardware and software, and different methods 
of file transfer. 
    What method to use for file transfers depends on the source 
host and the type of mailbox computer that you are using. The 
transfer usually takes place in two steps: 

    1. Transferring files from a remote data center to your local 
       mailbox host. 

    2. Transfer from your local mailbox host to your personal 
       computer. 

Transfer to your local mailbox host
-----------------------------------
We will explain the most commonly used method for those who only
have access to file transfer by email. This method can be used by 
everybody. 
    Transferring plain text files is easy. Files with imbedded 
word processor control codes will often have to be treated as 
binary files. More about this later. 
    To transfer a text to another user, just send it as an ordinary 
electronic message. 
    Getting text files from a library on a remote computer is a 
special case. Often, they can be had by sending a retrieval command 
(like GET) by email to the remote center. After a while, the file 
will be sent to your mailbox by email. You can read it like you 
read other mail. 
    Example: The file BINSTART can be retrieved from the KIDART 
directory on a computer center in North Dakota, U.S.A. It explains 
how to retrieve binary art files from the KIDLINK project's file 
libraries. 
    To get the file, send a message to the center's mail forwarding 
'agent' at LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU. Use the following command 
syntax in your text: 

    GET <directory name> <file name>

To get the BINSTART file, write the following command in the TEXT 
of your message: 

    GET KIDART BINSTART

Note that the command has to be put in the body of the mail and not 
in the subject field. The file will arrive in your mailbox after a 
while. 
    Also, note that lists of available files are usually available 
by using an "INDEX <directory name>" command. To get a list of 
files in the KIDART directory, add the command "INDEX KIDART" in 
your message above. 
    Non-LISTSERV libraries may use other retrieval commands. Often, 
you can get information of what commands to use by sending the word 
HELP to a mailing service (in the Subject area or in the body of 
the text). 

Transferring binary files
-------------------------
Users with a direct connection to the Internet usually have access 
to the FTP command (File Transfer Protocol). If they do, they often 
prefer FTP for transfers of binary files like computer programs, 
pictures, sound, and compressed text files. 
    The bad news is that the FTP command is not available to all 
users of Internet mail. These will have to use "FTP by mail," or 
other tricks to transfer such files. More about this in a moment. 
    The FTP command gives access to a special file transfer service. 
It works in the following way: 

    1. Logon to your local email host and enter 'FTP remote-
center-code'. Example: 'ftp 134.129.111.1'.
    This command will connect you to the center in North Dakota 
mentioned above. Here, you will be prompted for user name and 
password. Enter 'anonymous' as user name, and use your real name or 
email address as password. 
    This way of logging on to retrieve files is called "transfers 
by anonymous ftp." You can use this method on many hosts on the 
Internet. 

    2. When connected to the remote center, you can request transfer 
of the desired file to your mailbox. Before doing that, you may 
have to navigate to a given file catalog (cd directory), and tell 
the host that the transfer is to be binary (bin). Finally, initiate 
the transfer by entering a "GET file name" command. 

    3. The file will be transferred to your local mailbox computer 
at high speed. When the transfer is done, you logoff from the 
remote center to "get back" to your mailbox computer's prompt line. 
    Now, you can transfer the file to your personal computer using 
communications protocols like Kermit, XMODEM, ZMODEM or whatever 
else is available. 

Binary files transferred as text codes
--------------------------------------
If you do not have access to FTP, you must use ordinary email for 
your binary transfers. 
    Usually, email through the Internet can only contain legal 
character codes (ASCII characters between number 32 - 126). Most 
systems cannot transfer graphics or program files directly, since 
these files normally contain binary codes (which are outside this 
ASCII character range). 
    The solution is to convert binary files to text codes using a 
utility program called UUENCODE. The encoded file can be sent by 
ordinary email, as in this example:


  From TRICKLE@VM1.NoDak.EDU Fri Aug 16 16:32:37 1991
  Date:     Fri, 16 Aug 1991 09:31:34 CDT
  To: opresno@EXTERN.UIO.NO
  Subject:  Part 1/1 SIMTEL20.INF PD:<MSDOS.STARTER>

  The file PD:<MSDOS.STARTER>SIMTEL20.INF  has been uuencoded before 
  being sent. After combining the 1 parts with the mail headers
  removed, you must run the file through a decode program.
  ------------ Part 1 of 1 ------------
  begin 600 SIMTEL20.INF
  M6T9I;&4Z(%-)351%3#(P+DE.1B`@("`@("`@("`@("`@("`@("!,87-T(')E
  M=FES960Z($IU;F4@,C@L(#$Y.3%=#0H-"B`@(%M.;W1E.B!$=64@=&\@9&ES
  M:6P-"AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:
  M&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:
  6&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&AH:&@(Z
  `
  end
  -------- End of part 1 of 1 ---------

When you receive a message with uuencoded text, download it to your 
personal computer's hard disk. Use an editor to cut out the codes 
and paste them to an empty work file. Using the example above, the 
first line in your work file should contain: 

  begin 600 SIMTEL20.INF

and the last line should contain
  end

Now, use a utility program called UUDECODE to convert the file back 
to its binary form (or whatever). 
    More information about uuencoding and uudecoding is given in 
the BINSTART file mentioned above (for MS-DOS computers). It has
a detailed explanation, BASIC source code for making the program 
UUDECODE.COM, and a DEBUG script for those preferring that. 
    Versions of UUDECODE are also available for other types of 
computers. 

Transfer of pictures
--------------------
Denis Pchelkin in Protvino (Russia) is 11 years old, has two cats 
and one dog, and has contributed beautiful computer graphics art to 
the KIDLINK project (1992). 
    The file ART019 in the KIDART catalog of the North Dakota 
center contains one of his creations. It is a UUENCODEd picture 
in GIF graphics format. 
    You can retrieve Denis' creation by sending a GET command to 
LISTSERV@VM1.NODAK.EDU . Put the following command in the TEXT of 
your message: 

    GET KIDART ART019

The LISTSERVer will return a message filled with strange uu-codes. 
We assume that you have already retrieved the BINSTART file, and 
that you have a version of the conversion program. Your next step 
is uudecoding: 
    Read the message into an editor or a viewing program. Cut and 
paste the codes to a work file. Keep the original as backup. Use 
the UUDECODE.COM program to convert ART019 into a GIF formatted 
file. 
    Now, view the picture with your favorite graphics program. (Or 
use shareware GIF-viewers like PICEM, VUIMG, and VPIC for MS-DOS 
computers. These programs are available from CompuServe's IBM 
forums and other services.) 
    Sending binary files in uuencoded form has weaknesses. One is 
the lack of automatic error correction when sending/receiving e-
mail. Noise on the line can easily distort the picture. 
    File size is another problem. UUENCODEing typically increases 
file sizes by almost one third. Some mailbox systems restrict the 
length of individual messages that you can receive, and the file 
may just be too big. 
    If the uuencoded file gets too big, some services can (or will 
by default) split it up in parts and then sent separately. 
    Tons of uuencoded public domain and shareware programs are 
available for retrieval by ordinary email. 

FTP by email
-------------
While some services accept commands like GET KIDART ART019 by 
email, this is not so with the many so-called FTP libraries. Many 
of them can only be accessed by FTP. 
    Services exist that will do FTP transfers by email for those 
not having access to the FTP command. The most popular is at DEC 
Corporate Research in the U.S. 
    For more information, write a message to one of the following 
addresses:

              ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com 
              ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au

In the TEXT of your message, put the word "HELP". 
    FTPMAIL lets you uuencode binary files for transfers. It can 
split large files up into several messages, thus helping you around 
local restrictions on the size of each incoming mail message. 

Chapter 13: Cheaper and better communication
============================================

    Packet data services and data transportation
    services like Tymnet Outdial, Infonet, Internet,
    and PC Pursuit may help keep costs down. 
    About reducing the cost of using mailing lists. 

Many users access online services by calling them directly. A lot 
pay extra for long distance calls to other cities and countries, 
even when this means inferior transmission quality (like when noise 
characters degrade the data). 
    Others investigate other routings for their data. One option is 
the packet data networks. Most countries have Public Data Networks 
(PDNs) operated by local telecommunications authorities. These 
services are often cheaper than direct calls for some applications, 
but more expensive for others. 
    Before using a packet data network, you'll need to establish a 
"Network User Identification" (NUI) with the PDN carrier. You must 
also know the Network User Address (NUA) of the hosts that you want 
to access. 
    In Scandinavia, the local PDNs are called Datapak. They can be 
accessed by direct local calls or through leased lines. To personal 
users, direct calls are least expensive. A leased line may be cost 
efficient when the daily volume is high, like in a company. 
    When you communicate with online services through a PDN, the 
latter will split your data and bundle it in standard envelopes or 
'packets'. 
    Each packet is marked with a code and sent out into the data 
stream. Based on this code, the packet is routed from computer 
center to computer center until it reaches its final destination. 
There, the information will be reassembled into its original form 
before being handed over to a user or online service. 
    It is almost like traveling by train. The price per packet or 
traveler is lower than what it costs to rent the whole train for 
your trip. 
    National telecommunications monopolies were the first to offer 
packet data services. Their rates were moderately lower than for 
long distance calls, but it was hard to find the relationship 
between real costs and prices. This is still the situation in 
many countries. 
    Throughout the world, efforts to privatize nationwide phone 
networks continue. In many countries, this has given us some 
interesting competitors offering attractive rates for similar 
services. 
    Their rates differ considerably from country to country, as 
does the quality of transmissions. The advantage of using packet 
data also varies considerably, by application and by country. The 
best routing for retrieval of online news may be impossibly 
expensive for chats or complex online jobs. 
    We can offer no hard rules of thumb, except this: 

         Compare rates regularly!

What is cheapest?
-----------------
Some networks charge by the hour, while others charge by volume 
(number of characters transferred per minute). 
    When volume is low, your best bet is to use network services 
with a low price per minute and high prices for volume. 
    When volume is high, you may be better off using those charging 
by the minute. 
    To estimate costs reliably, you'll need statistics. Since your 
usage probably differs from what others do, start accumulating 
experience data now. Like this: 

    On services only charging for connect time
    ------------------------------------------
    Capture trip information to a log file. Register the following 
    information:
    * number of minutes connected
    * modem speed
    * number of characters transmitted.
    Some communication programs can do this automatically for you. 

    On services charging for time and volume
    ----------------------------------------
    Log the following information:
    * number of minutes connected
    * modem speed
    * number of segments or packets (measurements of volume)

You need this to estimate the average volume of data transferred by 
minute. Here are some general experiences and hints:
    Long streams of data without stops are cheaper through services 
that only charge by the minute. Retrieving software is a typical 
high volume application.
    Trips that include navigation from conference to conference, 
with a little bit of up- and downloading here and there, make the 
average transfer speed fall dramatically. It's like driving through 
a big city at 150 kilometers per hour. Red lights will reduce the 
average speed considerably. 
    The actual transferred volume of text per minute will differ 
from place to place (geographically), and often also from call to 
call. It depends on factors like: 

    * How fast you can enter commands and how much time you spend 
      staring at the display before pressing keys,
    * How long it takes for an online service to react to your 
      commands. For example, the response time on CompuServe at 
      04:00 GMT on a Friday morning (it is evening in the U.S.) is 
      much worse than at 10:30 GMT on a Sunday morning. Then, most 
      users are asleep. 
    * The load on your packet data network while you use the 
      service (or the amount of noise and retransmission, when 
      calling direct), 
    * The type of modem you are using (speed, level of MNP),
    * The number of commands you (or your scripts) have to enter
      during your online visit. An increase in the number of 
      commands, reduces the average transfer speed.
    * The amount of transfer overhead for color and screen handling 
      (like, VT-100 codes) that is transferred with your text.
    * Your use of menus and help texts while online, or whether 
      you come as "expert" with a minimum of prompts.
  
It's impossible to calculate the practical effects of these items. 
You will just have to bear them in mind when estimating typical 
jobs, measuring speeds, calculating costs, and comparing networks. 
    Finding the optimal network for our needs, will take time, but 
is well worth the effort. I think the figures may surprise you. 
    The network services in this chapter will often give you better 
quality transfers than a direct call. On the other hand, calling 
direct may give more characters transferred per minute. The average 
speed tends to drop dramatically when using a packet data service. 

Using national packet data services
-----------------------------------
Most commercial online services can be reached through national 
PDNs, but you may have problems finding the correct NUA (Network 
User Address) to get there. Few PDNs have a directory of available 
"electronic telephone numbers" for you to consult. 
    The Norwegian PDN, Datapak, used to be my only alternative for 
access to foreign online services, and I thought that the cost was 
acceptable. Not so anymore. 
    My applications require that data be pumped back and forth at 
maximum speed. On network services charging by a combination of 
volume and time, 80 percent of my costs are typically for volume, 
while 20 percent is for connect time. 
    When I log out after a successful visit to CompuServe through 
Datapak, the two services give me similar reports: 

  Thank you for using CompuServe!

  Off at 10:11 EST 24-Nov-87
  Connect time = 0:15

  CLR PAD  (00) 00:00:14:55 537 75 

The last line comes from Datapak. It tells that I have received 537 
segments and sent 75. 
    The "Segment" is Datapak's volume measure. A segment contains 
up to sixty-four characters and/or carriage returns. The price is 
calculated accordingly. 
    At today's prices, Datapak is still my cheapest alternative 
calling CompuServe for chats. 
    I use Datapak when connecting to TWICS in Tokyo, as the only 
alternative today is direct calls at a prohibitive cost. Once i-Com 
(see below) starts offering outdial to Japan, I expect this service 
to be substantially cheaper. 
    The slower your modem speed, the more attractive is Datapak 
compared with direct calls. 
    To get access to a national PDN, you must have a user 
identification and a password. (Getting temporary access to PDN 
services while traveling abroad is often hard and expensive.) 

  | Note: If you have access to a national PDN, but need        |
  | information about PDNs in other countries, try Hostess, the |
  | Global Network Service's information service from British   |
  | Telecom in England. The NUA is 02342 1920101013 (02342 is   |
  | the Data Network Identifier Code section of the address.)   |
  | Username or password is not required to use this service.   |

Outdial through PC Pursuit
--------------------------
Sprintnet (formerly GTE Telenet) lets American users call bulletin 
boards in North America at lower rates through their PC Pursuit 
service. 
    They pay a modest subscription to call a local number for 
access to PC Pursuit. Once connected, they can enter an electronic 
phone-number to connect to a so-called 'outdial modem' in another 
city. 
    Once connected to the outdial modem, they can give it dialing 
commands and have it call any local number. This way, they can use 
PC Pursuit to call an online service in the area, or the private 
modem of a friend. 
    We call PC Pursuit an Outdial service. Such services normally 
offer lower rates for access to remote bulletin boards than what 
it costs to call by long distance. Besides, they reduce the chances 
for noise on the line. 

Outdial through i-Com
---------------------
i-Com offers outdial to North American online services by reselling 
capacity from Tymnet's network (owned by British Telecommunications 
PLC). 
    In the United States, Galaxy Telecomm Corp. offers a similar 
service under the name Starlink. Outdial to numbers in Japan and 
Europe is planned. 
    i-Com markets its services to users in Europe and Japan, and 
have local access in Brussels, Paris, Lyon, Milano, the Hague, 
Eindhoven, Zurich, Geneva, London, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, 
Cambridge, Edinburgh, Leeds, Frankfurt, Cologne, Munich, Madrid, 
Stockholm, Copenhagen, and more. 
    The basic fee for access to the service is US$25.00 per hour 
(1992). You don't pay volume charges. The monthly subscription fee 
is US$8.00. You can pay using VISA or MasterCard/Eurocard. 
    In Norway, I have used i-Com to connect to The Well in San 
Francisco, MetaNet in Virginia, EXEC-PC in Wisconsin, and SciLink 
in Toronto, Canada. At the time, i-Com was cheaper than direct 
calls and Datapak for access to these services. 
    While an ID on your local PDN is only valid in your area or 
country, your i-Com ID can be used all over the world including 
several cities in North America. Once your plane has landed in 
Milano, you can dial the local i-Com node to connect to your 
favorite service. 
    i-Com also has a bulletin board (US$13.00/hour). These are some 
of its services: 

    * Search a database to find BBS numbers in a given area of 
      interest, or to locate outdial numbers in a given city or
      area code.
    * Conferences about how to use North American bulletin boards.
    * Retrieval of shareware and public domain software.
    * Online shopping of American goods at American prices.

Cheaper access to CompuServe
----------------------------
Wherever CompuServe has local access points, you'll be better off 
using these. You do not have to sign any special agreements. Your 
CompuServe ID is all you need. Payment for using these services 
will appear on your CompuServe bill. 
    CompuServe has special deals with a list of network services, 
like InfoNet Europe (formerly Computer Sciences Corp.), Istel, 
FALNET, FENICS, CompuPass, LATA Networks, Tymnet/Sprintnet. Enter 
the command GO LOG on CompuServe to get access information, and GO 
RATES for rates. 
    I have been using CompuPass from Japan, CompuServe's own 
network in the United States, Istel, InfoNet, and PDN services in 
Europe. 
    When at home, I usually use CompuServe's 9600 bps node in 
Stockholm, Sweden. It is even cheaper than calling Oslo for a 2400 
bps node for most of my jobs. There is no surcharge when accessing 
at non-prime time, and US$7.70 per hour during prime time (weekdays 
08:00 to 19:00 local time). In addition, I pay long distance rates 
to call the node. CompuServe has no extra charges for volume. 

  | Whenever CompuServe opens a new node in your vicinity, or     |
  | upgrades the modem speed on one of their nodes, look at the   |
  | effects on your total costs.                                  |
  |                                                               |
  | Use software for automatic access and navigation (like TAPCIS,|
  | OzCIS, or ATO). They give higher volume per minute and make   |
  | your accesses even more cost efficient.                       |

Before leaving for a business trip, visit CompuServe to find local 
access numbers in your destination cities. The list of countries 
includes Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, 
Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Holland, South Africa, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and England. 
    You can also access CompuServe through i-Com and other outdial 
services. 
    CompuServe has exchange of electronic mail with Internet. You 
can also access the service by telnet to hermes.merit.edu (binary 
transfers are impossible, though). 

IXI - a European alternative to PDN
-----------------------------------
IXI is an X.25 data network for European academic, industrial and 
governmental research centers. It is sponsored by the EEC under the 
ESRIN project, and is operated by the Dutch PTT. 
    IXI interconnects national research networks, many national 
public data networks and several specialized international 
networks. It works like a national PDN service, but uses its own 
Network User Addresses. Echo, STN, DIMDI, Data-Star and other 
database vendors can be accessed through IXI. 
    The service is not available to most users having email access 
through the Internet. 

Using DASnet to cross network boundaries
----------------------------------------
DA Systems forwards electronic mail and files (also binary files) 
across mailbox system boundaries for customers. They can send your 
mail to several large in-house systems, information networks, and 
over 60 commercial mailbox systems in 30 countries. 
    These are some systems on their list: ABA/net, Alternex 
(Brazil), ATT Mail, BIX, BITNET, CESAC (Italy), CIGnet, ComNet 
(Switzerland), CONNECT, Dialcom, Deutsche Mailbox, Dialcom, Envoy 
100, EIES, EasyLink, Euromail (Germany), FredsNaetet (Sweden), 
Galaxy, GeoNet (hosts in Germany, England, U.S.A.), GreenNet, INET, 
INFOTAP (Luxembourg), Mailbox Benelux, MCI Mail, MercanMail (Asia), 
MBK Mediabox (Germany), MetaNet, Nicarao (Nicaragua), NWI, OTC 
PeaceNet/EcoNet, Pegasus (Australia), PINET, Portal, PsychNet, San 
Francisco/Moscow Teleport, Telexphone (France), TeleRede 
(Portugal), Telehaus Nordhorn (Germany), Telemail, TEXTEL (the 
Caribbean), TWICS (Japan), UNISON, UUCP, Web (Canada), The WELL, 
Internet. 
    This list may suggest lack of connectivity between networks 
that do indeed have connections. For example, Internet email may 
easily be sent to ATT Mail, Alternex, BIX, BITNET, FredsNaetet, 
GeoNet, GreenNet, and many others on this list. Connectivity changes 
constantly. Check to see if you really need it, as this service is 
far from free. 
    DASnet also lets you send email as telex, fax and by ordinary 
mail. They charge you by the number of characters transferred, and 
the destination address. (Contact Anna B. Lange, DA Systems, Inc., 
U.S.A. Tel.: +1-408-559-7434, or write her at AnnaB@11.DAS.NET). 

FidoNet - grassroots playground
-------------------------------
FidoNet is an amateur network consisting of tens of thousands of 
bulletin boards all over the world. The network is "loosely 
coupled," meaning that most of the participating boards are not 
always connected. They call each others at regular intervals to 
exchange mail, often in the middle of the night when the rates are 
low. 
    Most FidoNet boards have conferences, and allow you to send 
mail to users of other systems. NetMail is a term often used for 
private FidoNet email. EchoMail is used about its international 
conferences. The selection of echomail conferences on a given 
FidoNet board can be as unique as the rest of the system. 

RelayNet
--------
is another global network of bulletin boards. It offers exchange 
of email between systems. Messages and conference items entered on 
one system will automatically be copied to other participating 
boards. Your costs for "talking" with others in other parts of the 
world are very small. 

Other grassroots networks
-------------------------
It doesn't take much to set up a bulletin board service, and it is 
as easy to connect BBS systems to each other in a dial-up network 
for regular exchanges of email, files and conferences. 
    All over the world, grassroots networks keep popping up with 
names like ILINK, AmNet, Suedd MB-Verbund, Starmail, MagicNet, A-
NET, MausNet, Zerberus-Netz, SMBX-NET, BASA-NETZ, you name it. 
    Many boards offer access to more than one grassroots network, 
as well as to the Internet. Thus, the ability to send global email 
is extended to new users every day. 

Other services
--------------
The PDN Connect-USA competes with Starlink in North America. 
(Connect-USA Communications, Inc., 2625 Pennsylvania NE Suite 225, 
Albuquerque, New Mexico. 505-881-6988 (voice), 505-881-2756 (FAX), 
505-881-6964 (BBS). ) 
    Global Access is a similar service reselling time on the 
Sprintnet network in North America. 

Reducing the cost of using mailing lists 
----------------------------------------
The problem of subscribing to mailing lists is that all discussion 
items come to you in individual messages. Each message comes with 
its own mailer header, and this information is generally completely 
useless. (Read "Returned mail" in Chapter 7 for details.) 
    Newer versions of the BITNET LISTSERV software provide commands 
that solve this problem: 

    SET <list name> DIGEST
    ----------------------
    This command is sent to a LISTSERV to make all daily messages 
    come to you in one, single message. Example: Say you've joined
    KIDCAFE@vm1.nodak.edu, which usually has a large number of
    messages each day. Send the following command to the LISTSERV:

    SET KIDCAFE DIGEST

    It will typically reduce the number of lines received from this 
    mailing list by around 50 percent. 


    SET <list name> INDEX
    ---------------------
    This command is sent to a LISTSERV to get a daily list of 
    messages, like in this example from KIDCAFE: 

    Index Date  Size Poster and subject
    ----- ----  ---- ------------------
    22839 06/22   26 From:    David Chalmers
                              <David.Chalmers@p3.f155.n633.z3.fidonet.org>
                     Subject: Conor Dublin Ireland

    Based on this list, you can use the LISTSERV's search commands 
    to retrieve individual messages of interest. These commands are 
    similar to those used for searching in chapter 7. 

    For more about searching mailing lists' message bases, send a 
    message to LISTSERV@vm1.nodak.edu with the following command in 
    the text of your mail:

    GET KIDLINK TIPS

    Some LISTSERVs offers simplified search commands and macros
    to make retrieval of individual messages simpler.

Chapter 14: Keep what you find
==============================


    Little is gained by being skillful at
    locating and accumulating information, 
    and then becoming drowned 
                  in an avalanche of data
    that one cannot manage       - or use.

This chapter starts with how to build a personal data base on your 
own hard disk. We continue by investigating strategies for finding 
interesting information on your disk, before winding down with some 
words about what separates good information from bad. 

Search and throw away
---------------------
To novices, everything is difficult. During the first online trips, 
they may feel as if moving to the other side of the globe to start 
over: They need new newspapers, magazines, information sources, and 
services. 
    Trial and error are required to find online gold mines. As you 
get more experience, focus tends to shift from getting information 
to digesting. 
    Getting the data gets 'into your fingers', and doesn't bother 
much anymore. The number of retrieved lines increases. The only bad 
news is that your reading speed remains at the same old level. 
    In our time, people tend to talk more than they listen, and you 
usually find more information than knowledge. Therefore, say NO to 
irrelevant information. It is seldom worth keeping. 
    There is generally no good reason to learn things that you 
really don't need to know. Practice "selective ignorance."
    Regularly evaluate your online sources critically, and discard 
those costing you more than they are worth. Concentrate on those 
giving the best returns. 
    Adjust the frequency with which you visit selected services to 
match their usefulness. What used to be daily visits, may have to 
be downgraded to once per week or month. Consider replacing daily 
news monitoring by clipping services. 
    Plan 'overview' and 'details' with different frequencies. 
'Overview' refers to online trips to get an impression of what 
generally goes on. An example: 

My script system is set for automatic visits to the CompuServe 
Toshiba forum. Whenever I visit, it 'digs out' unread messages 
based on key words on the item's subject line.
    During 1991, it searched for these strings: '5100', T2000', and 
'425'. Once, This gave the following message to read: 

     #: 29550 S6/Hi-Power Notebooks
         05-Oct-91  17:27:30
     Sb: #T2000SX Recharger
     Fm: Steve Kitahata 75166,1741
     To: All

     I tried to order the battery recharger for my T2000SX from Jade 
     Computer last weekend.  The sales rep said it would take about 
     a week, so I called today to check up on it.  He told me that I 
     could only buy the recharger with the car adapter as a bundled 
     set for $260.  They had both advertised in their flyer as 
     separate items, which they should be.  Has anyone heard of 
     this?  

     Does anyone know of any sources that have the battery recharger 
     available?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanx. 

     -- Steve 

My script found the search word "T2000" in the subject line's text 
(Sb: #T2000SX Recharger), and subsequently selected the message. 
    Once per month, the same system "scans the horizon" to give me 
an idea of what is going on. This is done by requesting a list of 
subjects being discussed. Here is part of one such list: 

     29555:  DOS 5 Upgrade               
             6 replies

     29540:  TDOS Upgrade questions      
             3 replies

     29585:  Toshiba DOS 5.0 ships!      
             1 reply

     29586:  DOS 5.0 Upgrade Solution    
     
     29580:  ToshibaDOS=bad business     
             8 replies

     29581:  DOS 5 / Stacker             
             1 reply

Reading the list, allows me to see if new and interesting topics 
are up for discussion. If I use Stacker and want contact with other 
users, I can request message number 29581 and the subsequent reply 
(1 reply). That should give me some email addresses. 

  | Several advanced communication programs and offline readers    |

  |                                                                |
  | When retrieving conference messages from bulletin boards using |
  | 1stReader at high speed, like 9600 bps or above, then the cost |
  | of downloading all new items may be insignificant. Therefore,  |
  | you might just as well do it.                                  |
  |                                                                |

  | select messages to read from a list of subjects. You can save  |
  | what you want to keep, and delete the rest.                    |

By regular scanning subject headers you reduce the risk of missing 
important trends, for example because authors were using other 
terms on the subject line than expected. 
    Scanning also lets us discover if the discussion is heading off 
in other, interesting directions. 
    After a while, you'll have a set of sources, persons, and tools 
that will provide you with what you need. This is your personal 
infrastructure of electronic information. Now, you must maintain 
and cultivate it. 

Store incoming information
--------------------------
Chances are that you will retrieve more information than you can 
read. Sometimes it takes weeks for me to get up to date with my 
own readings. 
    If you visit several online services, consider storing the data 
in files with different names. Use part of the file name to show the 
source of this information. 
    If visiting a service regularly, consider using the date as 
part of the file names. This will make it easier to select, read 
and search them in a useful sequence. 

  | Example: Say you're regularly visiting TWICS in Tokyo. What you |
  | download on November 10, you may store in a file named          |
  |                                                                 |
  |           TW1110.TMP                                            |
  |                                                                 |
  | My scripts do this automatically. On some services, they also   |
  | split retrieved data into URGENT and MAY BE READ LATER files.   |
  | Private mail from TWICS is stored in NB1110.TMP. By storing     |
  | private mail separately, it is easier to see if somebody wants  |
  | a quick reply.                                                  |

All file names in this example have the extension .TMP (temporary). 
This signifies that these files are unread. 
    When I read them, and select parts for permanent storage on my 
hard disk, I use different names. Often, I use the year, or a 
month/year code in the file name extension. For example, the file 
DIALOG.93 contains information from DIALOG collected during 1993. 

Postprocessing the data
------------------------
The data capture is completed, and the retrieved data is stored on 
the hard disk in more or several files. Your next task is to 

    * Read the received texts,
    * Cut and paste selected parts to archive or work files, 
    * Prepare responses to your electronic mail. This may include 
      quoting part of the incoming messages in your replies.
    * Finally, delete all temporary files. 

Many advanced programs have these features built in. If not, you 
may use your favorite word processor, or something else. There are 
many alternatives. 
    LIST is my favorite MS-DOS shareware file viewer program. It 
can be downloaded from most bulletin boards. Using LIST, it is 
difficult to destroy your precious retrieved data while reading, 
cutting and pasting.

  | the list.                                                       |
  |     Move the cursor (using the Arrow keys) to the input file    |
  | that you want to read and press Enter. Scroll up and down in the|
  | file by pressing the PgUp/PgDn or the arrow keys.               |
  |     Let's assume that you are reading TW1110.TMP right now.     |
  | On your screen is a piece of information that you want to       |
  | keep for future reference. Mark the text with ALT-M commands    |
  | (keep the ALT key pressed down, while pressing M), and then     |
  | ALT-D. LIST will ask you for a file name. You enter TWICS.93,   |
  | and the text is appended to what is already there.              |
  |     This method allows you quickly to mark and append parts     |
  | of your input file to various archive files. Press ESC to       |
  | return to the file list when through, then press D. LIST asks   |
  | if you really want to delete the file. Press Y, and TW1110.TMP  |
  | is gone.                                                        |
  |     LIST lets you find information stored in your archives      |
  | (string search). What you find can be marked and copied to a    |
  | work file. It can also be set to invoke an editor or a word     |
  | processor for the selected file.                                |
                                                                    
Reuse of data on your hard disk 
-------------------------------
Over time your personal archives will grow in size. You begin to 
experience the benefits of having all this information on your 
hard disk. 
    Yesterday's news is today's history, and may be used in many 
interesting ways. 
    One business executive regularly monitors key technologies,
customers, competitors, and suppliers. He does it by tapping 
sources like KOMPASS, Associated Press, and Reuters. Interesting 
bits of information are regularly stored on his disk. 
    Tomorrow, there is an important meeting with a major customer. 
First, a quick search through the personal customer database to be 
reminded of important events since the last meeting. An unfamiliar 
person is also going to be present. Maybe there is some background 
information, for example about a recent promotion. 
    Then, a quick check on major competitors. Maybe they are up to 
something that he needs to know about. 
    With efficient tools for searching your hard disk, finding 
information takes only a few seconds. If you are still left with 
open questions, go online to complement. 
    On MS-DOS computers, you can search the files with WordPerfect, 
LIST, the DOS utility FIND, and a long list of other programs. I 
prefer programs that let me search for more than one word at the 
time, like in HYDRO AND PETROCHEMICAL AND CONTRACT, or EXXON OR 
MOBIL. 

  | MY FAVORITE: My favorite search utility is LOOKFOR. It can     |
  | be downloaded from many bulletin boards. The MS-DOS program    |
  | is small, fast, and is superior for searches in DOS text files.|
  | Store your finds in work files, or print them out on paper.    |
  | LOOKFOR is not an indexing program. It is ready to search      |
  | anywhere, anytime.                                             |

Discipline and organization is required to get the most out of your 
file archives. You must decide what to do with each piece of 
information: Should it be printed out and be read in front of the 
fireplace this evening, or should it be circulated? Should it be 
stored on your hard disk, or be refined before storage? 
    Use standard file names that are easy to remember. If you 
don't, risk having to view files to find out what they contain. 
    It may take longer to find a piece of information in a casual 
file on a large disk, than look up a piece of information on paper 
in your inbox. Therefore, finish handling your capture file while 
you read it on your screen: 
    Send the pieces to their final destination. Make immediate 
transfers to your TO-DO files. Give the original file a name that 
makes it easier to move later. Have a procedure that prevents 
duplication of effort. 

Desinformation, deception and errors
------------------------------------
Always use several sources of information. Some people write to 
lead you astray.  The online world exposed some interesting 
incidents that came out of the former Soviet Union before the 
attempted coup in 1991. 
    Desinformation hurts everybody and comes from all sides. Even 
professional news agencies, like Associated Press, Reuters and 
Agence France-Presse, regularly stumble.
    Most news is written by journalists reporting what they have 
seen, read or heard. Their interpretation of the situation may be 
wrong. Supplement online news with what knowledgeable people say 
(by email or in conferences), when knowing the facts is important. 
    Another point: Errors will occasionally be discovered and 
reported by the news sources, but always after the fact. Always 
store these reports in your archives, and make it a rule to search 
to the end when looking for something. Otherwise, you may never 
discover these corrections. 

Chapter 15: You pay little for a lot!
=====================================


Calculating costs
-----------------
Those living in Norway may read up to twenty-six pages of news from 
Associated Press in the United States and Financial Times (England) 
for US$ 0.64, or less. 
    The trick is to dial long distance to a 9600 bps node in Sweden 
when the telephone company and CompuServe's non-prime time rates 
are in effect. 
    At 9600 bps, you may transfer text at up to 960 characters per 
second. One page of text (size A-4) holds around 2200 characters. 
A typical news story is one to two pages of text. 

  | Users watching the 'taximeter' can use online services at a  |
  | very low cost. For many, global communication is almost free.|

Reading exactly the same news through another network or service, 
may cost you 300 percent more. Through yet another online service, 
the cost may double again. 
    A full issue of the NewsBytes newsletter is around 150,000 
characters, or 68 pages of text. Retrieving it from a local BBS 
typically costs me around 29 cents. Retrieving the full text from 
CompuServe would cost me over 500 percent more. 
    Using NewsNet for the job, at 2400 bps through Datapak, would 
increase my current cost by more than US$30.00. 
    The time of day may be important. Some services have different 
rates for access during the day, the evening, and the weekend. 
    Use your calculator often. 

When you pay by the minute
--------------------------
When using bulletin boards, phone charges are often the only cost 
items. Some boards require a subscription fee for full access to 
the system. Still, it is easy to calculate the costs of your calls. 
Divide the subscription fee by an estimated number of calls, and 
add to the cost of using the phone. 
    The same applies to users of CompuServe. Their total cost is 
simply the sum of all connect charges, any network charges (to 
CompuServe and others), part of the basic subscription fee, and 
local phone rates (for direct dialing to the service, or to reach
the network's node). 
    Where a service uses a monthly subscription rate, add part of 
this to the time charges. Distribute the rate using an estimated 
number of online hours per month. 

    Example:
    You pay US$30/hour to access a service during prime time. Your 
    modem speed is 240 cps.

    Theoretically, if the data flows without pauses at system 
    prompts, you can transfer 392 pages of text in one hour. 
    Even when you deduct some characters due to stops in the 
    transfer, the resulting transferred volume remains respectable. 

    To transfer one page of text takes around nine seconds (2200 
    characters divided by the speed, which is 2400 bps, or about
    240 characters per second). The cost is nine cents. 

    A given binary file (a program) is 23552 bytes large. Using the
    XMODEM protocol, you can transfer it in about four minutes and 
    thirteen seconds. The cost is US$2.10. To find the cost when
    paying by the minute is simple. Just calculate the cost per
    minute or second, and multiply by the estimated connect time.

    On many services, it will take a minute or two before you can 
    start to receive text or files. Disconnecting also takes a few 
    seconds. Add this to the connect time when calculating costs. 

Pauses and delays in the transfer can be caused by you or others, 
and may have a dramatic impact. It is particularly important to 
take this into account when comparing alternatives using different 
networks. 

    Example: Transfers to TWICS via Datapak at 9600 bps rarely
    gave me higher effective speeds than 100 cps. The reason was
    that the connection between the Japanese telcom network and 
    TWICS went through a 1200 bps gateway. 

    A high speed connection to your data transporter's network does 
    not guarantee a high speed connection to the remote computer. 

    I used to go through Datapak at 9600 bps to a computer center
    in Oslo. There, I was connected through a local area network to 
    the host computer. The effective speed was rarely higher than
    4800 bps. Calling direct gave twice the speed.

Try to measure the effective transfer speed before selecting a 
routing for your data. Transfer the same amount of text through 
various networks. 
    If future transfers are likely to take place at a given time of 
day, test at that time. If your planned application is retrieval of 
programs, retrieve programs. If you want to read news, then read 
news from the services that you want to compare. 
    When a network service charging for volume (like Datapak) will 
also be part of a comparison, measuring volume is particularly 
important. Do not assume that you know the answer in advance.

  | NOTE: Always calculate the cost based on a fixed volume, like |
  | for the transfer of 1000 characters. This is particularly     |
  | important when you need to use different transfer speeds to   |
  | access competing services.                                    |

Network load varies considerably throughout the day depending on 
the number of simultaneous users, and their applications. This also 
applies to online services. The load is normally lowest, when the 
bulk of the users are asleep, and during weekends. When the load is 
low, you get more done per minute.

Planning and self-discipline pays off 
-------------------------------------
The actual cost of using a given set of services depends a lot on 
your self-discipline, the tools you use, and on how well prepared 
you are: 

    * If accessing manually, use "quick" commands rather than menus 
      to move at maximum speed to desired sources of information.

    * Do not set your services to be used with colors, sound, or 
      special methods for displaying graphics, unless you have no
      choice, or are willing to pay the extra cost. They increase 
      the volume of transferred text, and lower effective speed.

    * Get the information and disconnect. It is expensive - and
      usually unnecessary - to read captured text while online.
      Log off to read. Call back for more to read, disconnect, and 
      then call back again. 

    * Learn how to write your mail offline, and send the letters 
      "in a batch" to your mailbox. Your messages will often have 
      fewer typing errors, be better thought out, and the cost 
      will be considerably lower.

    * Consider automating your communication (see Chapter 16).
      I use Bergen By Byte this way. A while ago, it gave me the 
      following progress report: "Time on: 17 hrs 43 min, today 0 
      hrs 0 min, total 827 times." In average, I spend around 1.3 
      minutes per call. Yesterday, I was connected for 2:48 
      minutes. The result was 106 kilobytes' worth of conference 
      mail. 

Modem speed and cost
--------------------
2400 bps is a sensible modem speed for some applications, and used 
to be a good starting point for new onliners. The benefits of using 
a faster modem may be marginal under the following conditions: 

    * When navigating the online service considerably reduces the 
      effective speed, and you access the service manually. 
    * When you pay considerably more for access at higher speed. 
      (CompuServe charges extra for 9600 bps access, but not much.) 
    * When your networks do not offer higher speeds. 
    * When the relative price of a faster modem in your country
      is prohibitive. 

On the other hand, a modem doing 9600 bps or more, does give you 
considerably faster communication. If doing things faster is more 
important than keeping costs down, then it is a wise investment. 
This is the case for me. Besides, often it is definitely cheaper. 
    Your applications have a considerable impact on your costs. If 
you mainly use your modem for retrieval of programs and large data 
files from bulletin boards - and don't have to pay extra for volume 
- then higher modem speeds will immediately give reduced costs. 
    A slower speed modem may also stop you from getting what you 
want. For example, there are several shareware programs on my board 
that users of 2400 bps modems are unable to download within their 
allotted 30 minutes per day. 

When you pay for volume
-----------------------
Some network services, like Datapak in Norway, have high rates for 
volume, and very low rates for connect time. When using such 
services, automatic communication becomes less useful. Rather than 
connecting, getting a piece of information, disconnecting, and 
then going back for more, you may find it cost efficient to review 
menus and results while online. 
    When paying for volume, the online service's menus become 
luxury items. Using quick commands for navigating is cheaper. 
    Your comparisons will never be accurate when comparing with 
services charging for connect time. It is particularly difficult 
when the measure of volume is 'packets' rather than 'number of 
characters transferred'. 
    Datapak and many other PDN services reports your sessions like 
this: 

       CLR PAD  (00) 00:00:14:55 537 75 

These numbers say that you have been connected to a service for 14 
minutes and 55 seconds, that 537 data 'packets' have been received, 
and that 75 have been sent. Use these figures to calculate the cost 
of the call. 

  | One data 'packet' or segment contains up to 64 characters.     |
  | Think of it as a measure of the number of lines. Each line can |
  | have a maximum of 64 characters. If you send the character A   |
  | and a carriage return, then this also counts as a segment.     |
  |                                                                |
  | Consequently, it is hard to use the Datapak record to estimate |
  | the real number of characters transferred. All we know is that |
  | 537 + 75 segments were transferred, and that 612 segments may  |
  | contain up to 39,168 characters.                               |

When calculating the cost of a direct call, just the number of 
minutes counts. Use the time reported by the online service, and 
not your stop watch. CompuServe gives this type of report: 

       Thank you for using CompuServe!

       Off at 10:11 EST 24-Nov-92
       Connect time = 0:15

If the size of your log file was 15 KB after the first test, and 11 
KB after the second, then just adjust the latter to compare (Actual 
Cost/11*15). It is easy to compare services that only charge by 
the minute. 

More practical hints
--------------------
It is more expensive to call a service daily "to check the news," 
than to call it once per week to retrieve the same stories. 
    Navigating by menus is more expensive than going directly to a 
source, or going there by stacking commands (i.e., combining quick 
commands into one). 
    Many services let you read selective items in conferences by 
entering a search string. On my BBS, the following command 

    r extended 100+ c

lets you read all messages containing the search string 'extended' 
in the text starting with message number 100. 
    If you forget the "c" parameter, the flow will stop after each 
message. This will reduce the average effective speed. Always use 
"nonstop" commands when reading stories, conference items, and 
other texts. 
    Now, read the next chapter.
Chapter 16: Automatic communication
===================================

Automatic data communication as a development strategy.

    To get a lead on your competitors.
    To avoid duplication of effort.
    To reduce costs.
    To reduce boring and repetitive work.
    To avoid having to remember technical details. 

Automatic communication is both for professionals and amateurs. 
First, because it keeps the costs down. Second, because it lets 
you do the job faster and safer. 

We all have different needs
---------------------------
Automation will never be the same for everybody. Our needs are too 
different.
    Some get excited when a program can dial a bulletin board, 
retrieve a program, and then disconnect without them having to 
touch the keyboard. 
    Some want an "answering machine" that can respond to and 
forward email when he or she is away from the office.
    Others want a communications system that can tap selected news 
sources, search databases, and do postprocessing on the retrieved 
material. 
    For most professionals, doing things manually takes too much 
time. Time is better spent reading, digesting, and using, rather 
than on stupid technical retrieval work. Computers can do that.
    To others again, automation is a question of being able to use 
the online resource at all. If it takes 60 seconds to get a piece of 
information, it may be possible to get before running for the next 
meeting. 
    If it takes 15 minutes, however, there may not be enough time. 
If you also need to read a help text to find out how to do it, you 
may not even consider it. The mind is full of other things right 
now. 

  | When using a system for automatic communication, you do not |
  | have to learn and remember online commands. The system will |
  | do it for you.                                              |

The minimum solution
--------------------
Automatic data communication in its simplest form entails the 
following: 

    * One keypress to get the communications program to dial a
      number, and send user name/password when the online service
      requests this information.

    * Macro commands (like in a word processor) for navigating 
      through an online service, searching, and to send complex 
      commands by pressing one key.

Most communication programs have a macro language or a script 
language. You will probably never regret time spent on learning 
how to use these features. At a minimum, you should be able to have 
your system log on to a service automatically. 
    Autologon spares you the task of remembering your user name and 
password. Besides, most people are only able to use the keyboard at 
a low speed. They easily get frustrated by having to correct typing 
errors. 

Auto-logon with Procomm
-----------------------
Procomm is one of the most popular communications program in use 
today (see appendix 2). A Procomm script file is a text file, which 
can contain a list of commands for dialing and navigating on an 
online service. 
    When writing a Procomm script for auto-logon, your first step 
is to list the commands that you believe required. Enter them in a 
text file (as DOS or ASCII text). 
    In such scripts, you can test for the occurrence of a small 
piece of information that the online service is supposed to send at 
a given time (like the question "Password?"). 
    When this information is found, Procomm can be set to send the 
proper response or command (here, your secret password).
    Scripts can be tied to your favorite online services through 
Procomm's dialing directory. Press a key to start the appropriate 
script file for access to a service. 
    The following is a simple PROCOMM script file. It can be used 
to access my bulletin board in Norway. It assumes that your name is 
Jens Mikkelsen, and that the secret password is FOXCROOK4. You'll 
have to change this before testing. 

   ;
   ;Script file for auto-logon to SHS with PROCOMM and PROCOMM PLUS
   ;
   WAITFOR "our FIRST Name? "
   PAUSE 1
   TRANSMIT "Jens^M"
   WAITFOR "our  LAST Name? "
   PAUSE 1
   TRANSMIT "Mikkelsen^M"
   WAITFOR "ots will echo)? "
   PAUSE 1
   TRANSMIT "foxcrook4^M"
   WAITFOR "^JMore (Y),N,NS? "
   PAUSE 1
   TRANSMIT "n^M"
   WAITFOR "^JMore (Y),N,NS? "
   PAUSE 1
   TRANSMIT "n^M"
   WAITFOR "R] to Continue? "
   PAUSE 1
   TRANSMIT "^M"

It is not difficult. You probably understand a lot already. Here is 
the explanation: 

    * the ";" character at the beginning of a line identifies it as 
      a comment line. Procomm is to ignore it. We use such lines 
      for notes. 

    * WAITFOR "our FIRST Name? "
      has Procomm wait for the text string "our FIRST NAME?" from
      my BBS. It is a part of the question "What is your first 
      name?". 

    * PAUSE 1
      halts the execution of the script file for one second.

    * TRANSMIT "Jens^M"
      sends the name "Jens" followed by a Return (the code ^M in 
      Procomm). 

    * WAITFOR "our  LAST Name? "
      makes Procomm wait for the question "What is your LAST Name?" 

The script continues like this. In WAITFOR commands, we use part of 
the text that is displayed on our screen once the scrolling stops. 
     Make sure that the search term is unique. It must not appear 
elsewhere in the text coming from the host computer. If it does, 
your name and password may be sent too early. 
    You can call the script HORROR.CMD, and attach it to the entry 
for my board in your Procomm phone directory. When you call it the 
next time, Procomm will execute the commands in the file and "turn 
the keyboard over to you" when done. 

Macros in Procomm
-----------------
Above, we used a script to log on automatically to a service. When 
Procomm gives us access to the keyboard again, we must continue 
manually. 
    What we want to do online varies. Sometimes, we want to read 
new messages in conferences. In other cases, the purpose is to 
check new programs in the file library. If we find programs of 
interest, we may want to download them. 
    Shorthand macros can help you do this faster and safer. For 
example, one macro can take you quickly to a conference for new 
messages. You can make Procomm start this macro whenever you press 
ALT-0 (keep the ALT key down, then press 0). 
    You can have the macro key ALT-1 send other commands when in 
the file archives. 
    When I started using MS-DOS computers for data communications, 
PC-TALK became my favorite program. It has many of the same macro 
capabilities that Procomm has. 
    With PC-TALK, I did autologon to NewsNet. Macro number one sent 
commands that gave me the contents of various newsletters. Macro #2 
picked up the contents in another group. Macro #3 picked up stories 
from my mailbox, and macro #4 logged me off the service. My mission 
was completed by pressing four or five keys. 

Automating the full task
------------------------
It's a long way from automated logon scripts and the use of macros 
to automating the whole task. The major difference is that with 
full automation, you do not have to look at the screen while the 
script is working. You can do other things. Sometimes, you may not 
even be present when the job is being done. 
    On a typical morning, I go directly from bed to my office to 
switch my communications computer on. 
    While I visit the bathroom, my communications program calls 
three online services, retrieve and send information. 
    When the script has disconnected from the first service, which 
is my bulletin board, it analyzes the received data. I want an 
alphabetic list of visitors since my last visit, a sorted list of 
downloaded programs, and names of those calling in at 9600 bps or 
higher. 
    Sometimes, the unexpected happen. There may be noise on the 
line, or a sudden disconnect. Usually, my script can solve this 
without manual intervention. It is therefore allowed to work 
unattended most of the time. 
    When I get to my office after breakfast, it is all done. My 
communications program is set for reading and responding to today's 
email. I can sit down, and immediately get to work. 
    After having written all my replies, I say "send" to my system. 
For me, it's time for another cup of coffee. I am not needed by the 
keyboard while my mail is being sent. 
    This is what an automatic communications system can do. My 
scripts also help plan and prepare online visits, and ease my work 
by postprocessing results. 

  | When your communication is fully automated, you need not  |
  | read incoming data while it scrolls over your screen, and |
  | then again after logging off the service. You do it only  |
  | once.                                                     |

How to get it? Here are some alternatives: 

Alternative 1: Write your own system
------------------------------------
You can write procedures for powerful script-driven programs like 
ProYam (from Omen Technology) and Crosstalk MK IV. 
    I started writing scripts for ProYam over seven years ago. The 
system is constantly expanded to include new services, refined to 
include more functions, and enhanced to become more robust. 
    The scripts make my system work like an autopilot. It calls 
online services, navigates, retrieves and sends data. 
    Postprocessing includes automatic reformatting of retrieved 
data, transfers to various internal databases, statistics, usage 
logs, and calculation of transfer costs. 
    Such scripts can do quite complex operations online. For 
example, it can 

    - Buy and sell stock when today's quotes are over/under 
      given limits,
    - Select news stories and other types of information based 
      on information found in menus or titles.

Script writing is not for everybody. It is complicated, and takes a 
lot of time. Therefore, it is only for the specially interested. 
    On the other hand, those going for it seldom regret. Tailor-
made communication scripts give a wonderful flexibility. The 
software does not cost much, but again, it takes a lot of time! 

  | Do not use large and complex script files before you know the  |
  | online service well. The scripts let you do things quicker and |
  | safer, but there is always a possibility for unexpected        |
  | problems.                                                      |
  |                                                                |
  | Test your scripts for a long time to make them robust by       |
  | "training" them to handle the unexpected. Leave them to work   |
  | unattended when you are reasonably certain that they can do    |
  | the job. - It may take months to get to that point.            |
  |                                                                |
  | Build a timeout feature into your scripts, so that they don't  |
  | just hang there waiting for you after an encounter with fate.  |

Alternative 2: Use scripts made by others
-----------------------------------------
Some script authors generously let others use their creations. 
Earle Robinson of CompuServe's IBM Europe Forum, share his ProYam 
scripts for automatic usage of CompuServe with others. They are 
available from the IBM Communication Forum library. 
    Enter GO XTALK on CompuServe to find advanced script files for 
Crosstalk Mk.4. 
    ZCOMM and ProYam scripts for visiting my board automatically 
can be freely downloaded there. They split access up into these 
three phases: 

    Phase 1: Menu driven offline preparation.
    Phase 2: Automatic logon, navigation through the system, and
             automatic disconnection.
    Phase 3: Automatic offline postprocessing.

You will find scripts for other programs on many online services. 

Alternative 3: Special software
-------------------------------
Several online services sell communication programs with built-in 
functions that provides you with automation. They can have offline
functions for reading and responding to mail. The degree of 
automation varies. 
    There are also many programs written by third parties. Most 
programs assume that you use 'expert' as your default operating 
mode on the online service. 
    TapCIS, Autosig (ATO), OzCIS, CISOP, CompuServe Navigator (for 
Macintosh), AutoPilot (for Amiga), ARCTIC (for Acorn Archimedes), 
and QuickCIS (for Atari) are popular choices on CompuServe. TapCIS 
is my personal favorite. (CIM does not offer much automation!) 
    Aladdin is for GEnie. It automates your use of RoundTables 
(conferences), file areas, and mail. Dialog users turn to Dialog-
Link. 
    Nexis News Plus (for Nexis, US$50) has pull-down menus and 
detailed selection of commands. This MS-DOS program helps users set 
up detailed search commands before logging on to the Mead Data 
Central. Your search results will be downloaded automatically. 
    Personal Bibliographics Software, Inc. (Ann Arbor, Mich, U.S.A. 
Tel.: +1-313-996-1580) sells Pro-Search to Dialog and BRS users 
(for Macintosh and MS-DOS). 
    Pro-Search will lead you through menus to find information on 
both services. It translates your plain English search commands 
into the cryptic search language used by the services. It logs on 
automatically, connects to these services, finds your information, 
and shows you the hits. 

Alternative 4: Offline readers
------------------------------
The alternatives above have one important weakness. Noise on the 
line can prevent the "robot" from doing the job. All it takes is 
for noise to give a prompt another content than is expected by your 
program or script (as in "En@er a number:" instead of "Enter a 
number:"). 
    You can avoid noise problems by using get commands (see Chapter 
15), and by making the online service use its minimum prompts 
('expert mode') . Still, this does not give full protection. 
    The best is to let the online service do the navigation.  Think 
of it as logging on to run a batch file on the remote computer. 
Combine this with automatic transfers of your commands, transmitted 
in of one stream of data with automatic error correction (in the 
software and in the modem), and you have a very robust system. 
    The program logs on to the service. Then the service takes 
over. It registers your user identity, checks your user profile for 
personal interests, retrieves and packs all messages, news and 
files into one compressed file, and sends it to you at high speed. 
    Your outgoing messages, search commands, commands to join or 
leave conferences, and more, are transferred to the remote computer 
in a similar packet (compressed file). 
    When received by the remote computer, it unpacks the transfer 
file and distributes messages and commands to various services 
following your instructions. 
    Your "physical" contact with the service is when your modem is 
disconnected. The help menus that you read belong to your program, 
and not the online service. You read and respond to mail in a 
reading module (ref. the term "offline reader"). 
    Some offline readers give the caller access to more tools than 
is available on the online service itself. They may have spelling 
checkers, multimedia support, let you use your favorite editor or 
word processor, and offer various storage, search, and printing 
options. 
    Using offline readers is probably the easiest, cheapest, and 
safest way of using online services. These "readers" are popular
among bulletin board users, and some commercial services are also 
starting to accommodate them. 
    There are many offline reader programs. The most advanced take 
over completely upon logon, and manage transfers of commands and 
compressed information files to and from the host. (Example: 
Binkley Term on FidoNet) 
    Global Link is an offline reader for EcoNet. Bergen By Byte 
offers the BBS/CS Mail Grabber/Reader, a script system used with 
the communications program Telix and the service's "auto-get" 
function. 
    The most popular systems on the PCBoard based Thunderball Cave 
BBS are Offline Express, Megareader, Session Manager, Rose Reader 
and EZReader. These are used with scripts written for various 
communication programs. Some of them have built in communications 
(and script) modules. 
    EZReader from Thumper Technologies (P.O. Box 471346, Tulsa, OK 
74147-1346, U.S.A.) lets users retrieve mail from several online 
systems using transfer formats such as QWK, PCBoard capture files, 
ProDoor ZIPM files, XRS, MCI Mail, and others. Cost: US$49 (1992). 
    1stReader from Sparkware (Post Office Box 386, Hendersonville,
Tennessee 37077, U.S.A.) is my personal favorite for accessing 
Qmail based online systems. 

  | Note: Some offline readers contain all the features required    |
  | for fully automated communications. Some bulletin boards allow  |
  | up- and downloading to start right after CONNECT.               |
  |     Off-Line Xpress, an offline mail reader for QWK (Qwikmail)  |
  | packets, does not contain a communications module. It just does |
  | pre- and postprocessing of mail packets.                        |
  |     You can use the Off-Line Xpress as one element in a larger  |
  | automated system. For example, a system for access to PCBoard   |
  | bulletin boards may consist of Off-Line Xpress software, PKZIP  |
  | and PKUNZIP (popular shareware programs to compress/decompress  |
  | mail packets), the QMODEM communications program, and a script  |
  | to navigate to/from the QWK packet send and receive area on the |
  | BBS.                                                            |
  |     1stReader (version 1.11) contains a powerful script based   |
  | communications module. It lets you compose replies, set search  |
  | commands, subscriptions to services, add and drop conferences,  |
  | and enter download commands offline.                            |

Automatic automation
--------------------
We have explained how to write scripts with Procomm. However, there 
are simpler and quicker ways. Many communication programs can make
scripts automatically using a learning function. It goes like this: 
    Start the learning function before calling the online service. 
Then log on, navigate to the desired services, do what you want to 
automate, and disconnect. 
    The learning feature analyzes the received data and builds a 
script file for automatic communication. 
    If you call again with the new script, it will "drive the same 
route one more time." 
    ZCOMM and ProYam have a learning feature. This is how I made a 
script for accessing Semaforum BBS using ZCOMM: 

    ZCOMM asked for a phone number. I entered +47-370-11710. It
    asked for speed, and I entered 2400 bps. Next, I had to choose 
    one of the following:

      (1) System uses IBM PC (ANSI) line drawing
      (2) 7 bits even parity
      (3) 8 bits no parity 

    My choice was 1.
      ZCOMM dialed the number. When the connection was established,
    I entered my name and password, navigated to the message 
    section, read new messages, browsed new files in the library, 
    and entered G for Goodbye. This was the "tour" that I wanted to 
    automate. 
      When disconnected, I pressed the F1 key. This prompted the 
    learning process based on a record of the online tour. The log 
    described everything that had happened in detail, including my 
    pauses to think. Now I was prompted by the following question: 

      'newscr.t' exists. Append/replace/quit? 

    I selected append. Then: 

       Do you want this script file as a new entry in your
       telephone directory (y/n)?

    I entered "y," and named it "semaforum."  After a few seconds, 
    my new script was ready: 

       Your new script is in the file 'newscr.t' !!
       You can append the file to your current script file
       (for example PHODIR.T) or have the commands executed by
       entering:
          call semaforum.newscr.t 

    It was time to test the new wonder. I entered 
    
          call semaforum.newscr.t

    at the ZCOMM command line, hit the Enter key, and off it went. 
    ZCOMM called the BBS and repeated everything - at far higher 
    speed than I had done it manually. It went on-hook as planned 
    when done. 

Limitations
-----------
Auto-learn programs can create a script file that let you "drive 
the same route." For some applications this is enough. For others, 
it's just part of the way. You have to refine the script manually 
to get what you want. 

    Example:
    If you call my bulletin board with an auto-learned script made 
    yesterday, chances are that everything works well. If you call 
    twice on the same day, however, you're in for a surprise. The 
    board greets you differently on your second visit. You will not 
    get the menu of available bulletins. It will take you directly 
    to the system's main menu. Your script must take this into 
    account. 

On most online services, many things can happen at each "junction 
of your road." At one point in one of my scripts, up to twenty 
things may happen. Each event needs its own "routing." 
    Twenty possible events are an extreme, but three to four 
possibilities at each system prompt is not unusual. All of them 
need to be handled by your script, if you want it to visit online 
services unattended while asleep. 
    It is quicker and simpler to use other people's scripts and 
programs, although this might force you to use a different program 
for each service. 
    Personally, I prefer offline readers on services where such are 
able to do the job. On other services, I usually depend on my own 
tailor-made scripts. 
Chapter 17: Gazing into the future
==================================

Thoughts about things to come.

Newspaper of the future
---------------------------
Some years ago, Nicholas Negroponte of Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, said that today's newspapers are old-fashioned and soon 
to be replaced by electronic "ultra personal" newspapers. 
    "If the purpose is to sell news," he said, then it must be 
completely wrong to sell newspapers. Personally, I think that it is 
a dreadful way of receiving the news." 
    MIT's Media Laboratory had developed a new type of electronic 
newspaper. Daily, it delivered personalized news to each researcher. 
The newspaper was "written" by a computer that searched through the 
news services' cables and other news sources according to each 
person's interest profile. 
    The system could present the stories on paper or on screen. It 
could convert them to speech, so that the "reader" could listen to 
the news in the car or the shower. 
    In a tailor-made electronic newspaper, personal news makes big 
headlines. If you are off for San Francisco tomorrow, the weather 
forecasts for this city is front page news. Email from your son 
will also get a prominent place. 
    "What counts in my newspaper is what I consider newsworthy," 
said Negroponte.
    He claimed that the personal newspaper is a way of getting a 
grip on the information explosion. "We cannot do it the old way 
anymore. We need other agents that can do prereading for us. In 
this case, the computer happens to be our agent." 

The technology is already here. Anyone can design similar papers 
using powerful communication programs with extensive script 
features. I have tried. 
    My test edition of The Saltrod Daily News did not convert news 
to sound. It did not look like a newspaper page on my screen. Not 
because it was impossible. I simply did not feel these 'extras' 
worth the effort. 
    My personal interest profile was taken care of by my scripts. 
If I wanted news, the "news processor" went to work and "printed" 
a new edition. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, I got an 
"extended edition." 
    This is a section from my first edition: 

    "Front page," Thursday, November 21.
    Under the headline News From Tokyo, the following items: 

     TOSHIBA TO MARKET INEXPENSIVE PORTABLE WORD PROCESSOR 
     TOHOKU UNIVERSITY CONSTRUCTING SEMICONDUCTOR RESEARCH LAB 
     MEITEC, U.S. FIRM TO JOINTLY MARKET COMPUTER PRINTER INFO 
     TOSHIBA TO SUPPLY OFFICE EQUIPMENT TO OLIVETTI 
     NISSAN DEVELOPS PAINT INSPECTION ROBOT 
     MADE-TO-ORDER POCKET COMPUTER FROM CASIO

    These articles were captured from Kyoto News Service through
    Down Jones/News Retrieval.

    The column with news from the United States had stories from
    NEWSBYTES newsletters:

     * DAY ONE COMDEX. 
     * IBM'S PRE ANNOUNCEMENT OF "CLAMSHELL" 
     * AT&T TO JUMP IN SOONER WITH LAPTOP COMPUTER 
     * COMMODORE THIRD CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY LOSS 
     * 2 ZENITH UNVEILS TOUCH-SCREEN 
     * HP's EARNINGS DROP 

    Hot News From England came from several sources, including 
    Financial Times, and Reuters (in CompuServe's UK News). 
    Headlines read:

     * THE CHRISTMAS SELLING WAR 
     * BIG MACS GOING CHEAP TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS 

    "Page 2" was dedicated to technology intelligence. "Page 3" 
    had stories about telecommunications, mainly collected from 
    NewsNet's newsletters. "Page 4" had stories about personal 
    computer applications. 

As the cost of communicating and using online services continues to 
decrease, many people will be able to do the same. This is where we 
are heading. 
    Some people say it is too difficult to read news on a computer 
screen. Maybe so, but pay attention to what is happening in 
notebook computers. This paragraph was written on a small PC by the 
fireplace in my living room. The computer is hardly any larger or 
heavier than a book. 
    (Sources for monitoring notebook trends: NEWSBYTES' IBM and 
Apple reports, CompuServe's Online Today, and IBM Hardware Forum.) 

Electronic news by radio
------------------------
If costs were of no concern, then your applications of the online 
world would probably change considerably. Pay attention, as we are 
moving fast in that direction. 
    Radio is one of the supporting technologies. It is used to 
deliver Usenet newsgroup to bulletin boards (example: PageSat Inc. 
of Palo Alto, U.S.A.) Also, consider this: 
    Businesses need a constant flow of news to remain competitive. 
Desktop Data Inc. (tel. +1-617-890-0042) markets a real-time news 
service called NewsEDGE in the United States and Europe. They call 
it "live news processing." Annual subscriptions start at US$20,000 
for ten users (1993). 
    NewsEDGE continuously collects news from more than 100 news 
wires, including sources like PR Newswire, Knight Ridder/Tribune 
Business News, Dow Jones News Service, Dow Jones Professional 
Investor Report and Reuters Financial News. 
    The stories are "packaged" and immediately feed to customers' 
personal computers and workstations by FM, satellite, or X.25 
broadcast: 

    * All news stories are integrated in a live news stream all day 
      long,

    * The NewsEdge software manages the simultaneous receipt of 
      news from multiple services, and alerts users to stories that 
      match their individual interest profiles. It also maintains a 
      full-text database of the most recent 250,000 stories on the 
      user's server for quick searching. 

Packet radio
------------
A global amateur radio network allows users to modem around the 
world, and even in outer space. Its users never get a telephone 
bill. 
     There are over 700 packet radio based bulletin boards (PBBS). 
They are interconnected by short wave radio, VHF, UHF, and 
satellite links. Technology aside, they look and feel just like 
standard bulletin boards. 
     Once you have the equipment, can afford the electricity to 
power it up, and the time it takes to get a radio amateur license, 
communication itself is free. 
    Packet radio equipment sells in the United States for less 
than US$ 750. This will give you a radio (VHR tranceiver), antenna, 
cable for connecting the antenna to the radio, and a controller 
(TNC - Terminal Node Controller). 
    Most PBBS systems are connected to a network of packet radio 
based boards. Many amateurs use 1200 bps, but speeds of up to 
56,000 bps are being used on higher frequencies (the 420-450 MHz 
band in the United States). 
    Hams are working on real-time digitized voice communications, 
still-frame (and even moving) graphics, and live multiplayer games. 
In some countries, there are also gateways available to terrestrial 
public and commercial networks, such as CompuServe, and Usenet. 
    Packet radio is demonstrated as a feasible technology for 
wireless extension of the Internet.
    Radio and satellites are being used to help countries in the 
Third World. Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA), a private, 
nonprofit organization, is one of those concerned with technology 
transfers in humanitarian assistance to these countries. 
    VITA's portable packet radio system was used for global email
after a volcanic eruption in the Philippines in 1991. Today, the 
emphasis is on Africa.
    VITA's "space mailbox" passes over each single point of the 
earth twice every 25 hours at an altitude of 800 kilometers. When 
the satellite is over a ground station, the station sends files and 
messages for storage in the satellite's computer memory and 
receives incoming mail. The cost of ground station operation is 
based on solar energy batteries, and therefore relatively cheap. 
    To learn more about VITA's projects, subscribe to their mailing 
list by email to LISTSERV@AUVM.BITNET. Use the command SUB DEVEL-L 
<First-name Last-name>.
    For more general information about packet radio, check out 
HamNet on CompuServe, and especially its library 9. Retrieve the 
file 'packet_radio' (Packet radio in earth and space environments 
for relief and development) from GNET's archive (see chapter 7). 
    ILINK has an HAMRADIO conference. There is a packet radio 
mailing list at PACKET-RADIO@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL (write PACKET-
RADIO-REQUEST@@WSMR-SIMTEL20.ARMY.MIL to subscribe). 
    Usenet has rec.radio.amateur.packet (Discussion about packet 
radio setups), and various other rec.radio conferences. There is 
HAM_TECH on FidoNet, and Ham Radio under Science on EXEC-PC. 
    The American Radio Relay League (AARL) operates an Internet 
information service called the ARRL Information Server. To learn 
how to use it, send email to info@arrl.org with the word HELP in 
the body of the text. 

Cable TV
--------
Expect Cable TV networks to grow in importance as electronic high-
ways, to offer gateways into the Internet and others, and to get 
interconnected not unlike the Internet itself. 
    Example: Continental Cablevision Inc. (U.S.A.) lets customers 
plug PCs and a special modem directly into its cable lines to link 
up with the Internet. The cable link bypasses local phone hookups 
and provide the capability to download whole books and other 
information at speeds up to 10 million bits per second.

Electronic mail on the move
---------------------------
For some time, we have been witnessing a battle between giants. On 
one side, the national telephone companies have been pushing X.400 
backed by CCITT, and software companies like Lotus, Novell, and 
Microsoft. 
    On the other side, CompuServe, Dialcom, MCI Mail, GEISCO, 
Sprint, and others have been fighting their wars. 
    Nobody really thought much about the Internet, until suddenly, 
it was there for everybody. The incident has changed the global 
email scene fundamentally. 
    One thing seems reasonably certain: that the Internet will 
grow. In late 1992, the president of the Internet Society (Reston, 
Va., U.S.A.) made the following prediction: 

    ".. by the year 2000 the Internet will consist of some 100 
    million hosts, 3 million networks, and 1 billion users (close
    to the current population of the People's Republic of China).
    Much of this growth will certainly come from commercial 
    traffic."

We, the users, are the winners. Most online services now understand 
that global exchange of email is a requirement, and that they must
connect to the Internet.
    Meanwhile, wild things are taking place in the grassroots 
arena: 

    * Thousands of new bulletin boards are being connected to 
      grassroots networks like FidoNet (which in turn is connected 
      to the Internet for exchange of mail). 

    * Thousands of bulletin boards are being hooked directly into 
      the Internet (and Usenet) offering such access to users at 
      stunning rates. 

    * The BBSes are bringing email up to a new level by letting
      us use offline readers, and other types of powerful mail 
      handling software. 

Email will never be the same. 

Cheaper and better communications
---------------------------------
During Christmas 1987, a guru said that once the 9600 bps V.32 
modems fell below the US$1,200 level, they would create a new 
standard. Today, such modems can be bought at prices lower than 
US$200. In many countries, 14,400 bits/s modems are already the 
preferred choice. 

Wild dreams get real
--------------------
In the future, we will be able to do several things simultaneously 
on the same telephone line. This is what the promised land of ISDN
(Integrated Service Digital Networks) is supposed to give us. 
    Some users already have this capability. They write and talk 
on the same line using pictures, music, video, fax, voice and data. 
    ISDN is supposed to let us use services that are not generally 
available today. Here are some key words: 

    * Chats, with the option of having pictures of the people
      we are talking to up on our local screen (for example in
      a window, each time he or she is saying something). 
      Eventually, we may get the pictures in 3-D. 

    * Database searches in text and pictures, with displays of
      both. 

    * Electronic transfers of video/movies over a telephone line
      (fractal image compression technology may give us another 
      online revolution). Imagine dances filmed by ethnologists 
      at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., or an 
      educational film about the laps in northern Norway from 
      an information provider called the Norwegian Broadcasting
      Corp. 

      The "Internet Talk Radio" is already delivering programs by 
      anonymous ftp (e.g., through ftp.nau.edu in the directory 
      /talk-radio). 

    * Online amusement parks with group plays, creative offerings
      (drawing, painting, building of 3-D electronic sculptures),
      shopping (with "live" people presenting merchandise and
      good pictures of the offerings, test drives, etc.), casino
      (with real prizes), theater with live performance, online
      "dressing rooms" (submit a 2-D picture of yourself, and 
      play with your looks), online car driving schools (drive a
      car through Tokyo or New York, or go on safari). 

      The Sierra Network has been playing around with these ideas 
      for quite some time.

    * Your favorite books, old as new, available for on-screen 
      reading or searching in full text. Remember, many libraries 
      have no room to store all the new books that they receive. 
      Also, wear and tear tend to destroy books after some time. 

      Many books are already available online, including this one. 

    * Instant access to hundreds of thousands of 'data cottages'.
      These are computers in private homes of people around the 
      world set up for remote access. With the technical advances
      in the art of transferring pictures, some of these may grow
      to become tiny online "television stations."

These wild ideas are already here, but it will take time before 
they are generally available. New networks need to be in place. New 
and more powerful communications equipment has to be provided. 
    Farther down the road, we can see the contours of speech-based 
electronic conferences with automatic translation to and from the 
participants' languages. Entries will be stored as text in a form 
that allows for advanced online searching. We may have a choice 
between the following: 

    * To use voice when entering messages, rather than entering 
      them through the keyboard. The ability to mix speech, text, 
      sound and pictures (single frames or live pictures). 

    * Messages are delivered to you by voice, as text or as a 
      combination of these (like in a lecture with visual aids). 

    * Text and voice can be converted to a basic text, which then 
      may be converted to other languages, and forwarded to its
      destination as text or voice. 

One world
---------
Within the Internet, the idea of "the network as one, large 
computer" has already given birth to many special services, like 
gopher and WAIS. Potentially, we will be able to find and retrieve 
information from anywhere on the global grid of connected systems. 
    Bulletin boards have commenced to offer grassroots features 
modeled after telnet and ftp. These alternatives may even end up 
being better and more productive than the interactive commands 
offered "inside" the Internet. 
    The global integration of online services will continue at full 
speed, and in different ways. 

Rates
-----
There is a trend away from charging by the minute or hour. Many 
services convert to subscription prices, a fixed price by the 
month, quarter or year. 
    Other services, among them some major database services, move
toward a scheme where users only pay for what they get (no cure, no 
pay). MCI Mail was one of the first. There, you only pay when you 
send or read mail. On CompuServe's IQuest, you pay a fixed price 
for a fixed set of search results. 

Cheaper transfers of data
-------------------------
Privatization of the national telephone monopolies has given us 
more alternatives. This will continue. Possible scenarios: 

    * Major companies selling extra capacity from their own
      internal networks,

    * Telecommunications companies exporting their services at
      extra low prices, 

    * Other pricing schemes (like a fixed amount per month with
      unlimited usage),

    * New technology (direct transmitting satellites, FM, etc.)

So far, data transporters have been receiving a disproportionate 
share of the total costs. For example, the rate for accessing 
CompuServe from Norway through InfoNet is US$11.00, while using the 
service itself costs US$12.80 at 2400 bps. 
    Increased global competition in data transportation is quickly 
changing this picture, supported by general access to the Internet. 
Prices will most likely continue their dramatic way toward zero. 

Powerful new search tools
-------------------------
As the sheer quantity of information expands, the development of 
adequate finding tools is gaining momentum. Our major problem is 
how to use what we have access to. 
    This is especially true on the Internet. Expect future personal 
information agents, called "knowbots," which will scan databases 
all over the online world for specific information at a user's 
bidding. This will make personal knowledge of where you need to go
redundant. 
    Artificial intelligence will increase the value of searches, as 
they can be based on your personal searching history since your 
first day as a user. 
    Your personal information agents will make automatic decisions 
about what is important and what is not in a query. When you get 
information back, it will not just be in the normal chronological 
order. It will be ranked by what seems to be closest to the query. 

Sources for future studies
--------------------------
It seems appropriate to end this chapter with some online services 
focusing on the future: 
    Newsbytes has a section called Trends. The topic is computers 
and communications. ECHO has the free database Trend, the online 
edition of the Trend Monitor magazine. It contains short stories 
about the development within electronics and computers (log on to 
ECHO using the password TREND). 
    Usenet has the newsgroup clari.news.trends (Surveys and 
trends). Why not complement what you find here by monitoring trends 
in associated areas (like music), to follow the development from 
different perspectives? The music forum RockNet on CompuServe has a 
section called Trends. 
    CompuServe's Education Forum has the section Future Talk. What 
educators think about the future of online services (and education) 
is always interesting. The Well, based just outside Silicon Valley 
in the United States, has The Future conference. 
    UUCP has info-futures. Its purpose is "to provide a speculative 
forum for analyzing current and likely events in technology as they 
will affect our near future in computing and related areas." 
(Contact: info-futures-request@cs.bu.edu for subscription.) 
    Usenet has comp.society.futures about "Events in technology 
affecting future computing." 
    It is tempting to add a list of conferences dedicated to 
science fiction, but I'll leave that pleasure to you. 

    Have a nice trip!


Appendix 1: List of selected online services

Big Sky Telegraph
-----------------
is an online community for educators, business people etc. living 
in rural areas in North America. Address: 710 South Atlantic, 
Dillon, Montana 59725, U.S.A. 

BITNET
------
"Because It's Time NETwork" started in 1981 as a small network for 
IBM computers in New York, U.S.A. Today, BITNET encompasses 3,284 
host computers by academic and research institutions all over the 
world. It has around 243,016 users (source: Matrix News 1993) 
    All connected hosts form a worldwide network using the NJE 
(Network Job Entry) protocols and with a single list of nodes. 
There is no single worldwide BITNET administration. Several 
national or regional bodies administer the network.
    The European part of BITNET is called EARN (European Academic 
Research Network), while the Canadian is called NetNorth. In Japan 
the name is AsiaNet. BITNET also has connections to South America. 
Other parts of the network have names like CAREN, ANSP, SCARNET, 
CEARN, GULFNET, HARNET, ECUANET, and RUNCOL. 
    Normally, a BITNET email address looks like this:

         NOTRBCAT@INDYCMS

The part to the left of the @-character is the users' mailbox code. 
The part to the right is the code of the mailbox computer. It is 
common for Internet users to refer to BITNET addresses like this:
NOTRBCAT@INDYCMS.BITNET .
    To send email from the Internet to BITNET, it has to be sent 
through special gateway computers. On many systems, this is taken 
care of automatically. You type NOTRBCAT@INDYCMS.BITNET, and your
mailbox system does the rest.
    On some systems, the user must give routing information in the 
BITNET address. For example, North American mail to BITNET can be 
sent through the gateway center CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU . To make mail to 
NOTRBCAT go through this gateway, its mail address must be changed 
as follows: 

         NOTRBCAT%INDYCMS.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU

Explanation: The @ in the initial address is replaced with % . Then 
add the gateway routing: ".BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU". 
    If you must use a gateway in your address, always select one 
close to where you live. Ask your local postmaster for the correct 
addressing in your case. 
    BITNET has many conferences. We call them discussion lists or 
mailing lists. The lists are usually administered by a computer 
program called LISTSERV. The dialog is based on redistribution of 
ordinary email by mailing lists. Consequently, it is simple for 
users of other networks to participate in BITNET conferences. 
    A list of discussion lists (at present around 1,600 one-line 
descriptions) is available by email from LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.BITNET. 
Write the following command in the TEXT of your message: 

    LIST GLOBAL

NEW-LIST@NDSUVM1.BITNET and NETMONTH (from BITLIB@YALEVM.BITNET) 
distribute regular notices about new discussion lists. Subscribe to 
NEW-LIST by email to LISTSERV@NDSUVM1.BITNET. Use the following 
command: 

    SUB NEW-LIST Your-first-name Your-last-name

This is how we usually subscribe to discussion lists. Send your 
subscription commands to a LISTSERV close to where you live.
    The command "SENDME BITNET OVERVIEW" tells LISTSERV to send 
more information about the services.

FidoNet
-------
was founded in 1984 for automatic transfers of files from one place 
to the other at night, when the telephone rates are low. FidoNet is 
one of the most widespread networks in the world. It consists 
mainly of personal computers (IBM/Amiga/Macintosh...). 
    FidoNet systems exchange documents by using a modem and calling 
another FidoNet system.  Communication can be either direct to the 
destination system (calling long distance) or by routing a message 
to a local system. 
    Each computer connected to FidoNet is called a node. There are 
nodes in around 70 countries. In June 1993, the net had 24,800 
nodes throughout the world (source: FidoNet nodelist). The number 
of nodes is growing at about 40 percent per year. 
    Most nodes are operated by volunteers, and access is free. 
FidoNet is believed to have over 1.56 million users (1992). 
    Conferences (called ECHOs or Echomail) are exchanged between 
interested nodes, and may thus have thousands of readers. A typical 
FidoNet Echomail conference gets 50 to 100 messages each day. Any 
connected BBS may carry 50, 100, or more echomail conferences.
    Net Mail is the term for storing and delivering mail. FidoNet 
users can send and receive mail through the Internet. 
    The list of member bulletin boards is called the Nodelist. It 
can be retrieved from most boards. Each node has one line on this 
list, like in this example: 

   ,10,Home_of_PCQ,Warszawa,Jan_Stozek,48-22-410374,9600,V32,MNP,XA

The commas are field separators. The first field (empty in this 
example) starts a zone, region, local net, Host, or denotes a 
private space (with the keyword Pvt).

INTERNET
--------
started as ARPANET, but is now a large group of more than 6,000 
interconnected networks all over the world supporting mail, news, 
remote login, file transfer, and many other services. All 
participating hosts are using the protocol TCP/IP. 
    There are around 1.3 million host computers with IP addresses 
(March 1992. Ref. RFC1296 and RFC 1181). The number of users is 
estimated to more than ten million people. Some one million people 
are said to exchange email messages daily. 
    In addition, private enterprise networks have an estimated 
1,000,000 hosts using TCP/IP (Source: Matrix News August 1993.) 
These offer mail exchange with the Internet, but not services such 
as Telnet or FTP to most parts of the Internet, and are estimated 
to have some 7.5 million users. 
    Some claim that these figures are low. They believe it is 
possible to reach around 50 million mailboxes by email through the 
Internet. 
    Several commercial companies offer full Internet services. 
Among these are Alternet (operated by UUNET) and PCI (operated by 
Performance Systems, Inc.). The UK Internet Consortium offers 
similar services in Great Britain. 
    INTERNET gives users access to the ftp and telnet commands. Ftp 
gives them interactive access to remote computers for transferring 
files. Telnet gives access to a remote service for interactive 
dialog. 
    The Interest Groups List of Lists is a directory of conferences 
available by ftp from ftp.nisc.sri.com (192.33.33.53).  Log in to 
this host as user "anonymous." Do a 'cd' (change directory) to the 
"netinfo" directory, then enter the command "GET interest-groups." 
The list is more than 500 KB characters long. 
    You can also get it by email from mail-server@nisc.sri.com . 
Write the following command in the TEXT of the message: 

    Send netinfo/interest-groups

available by email from SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL . Send email with the 
following command in the message's SUBJECT heading: 

    RFC 1206

One important feature of the Internet is that no one is in charge.  
The Internet is essentially a voluntary association. 
    Another thing is that there are rarely any additional charges 
for sending and receiving electronic mail (even when sending to 
other networks), retrieving files, or reading Usenet Newsgroups..

UUCP
----
UUCP (UNIX to UNIX Copy) is a protocol, a set of files and a set 
of commands to copy files from one UNIX computer to another.     
This copying procedure is the core of the UUCP network, a loose 
association of systems all communicating with the UUCP protocol. 
    UNIX computers can participate in the UUCP network (using 
leased line or dial-up) through any other UNIX host. The network 
now also has many MS-DOS and other hosts, and consisted of 16,300 
hosts in January 1993 (source: UUCP map) serving more than 489,000 
users. 
    The UUCP network is based on two systems connecting to each 
other at specific intervals, and executing any work scheduled for 
either of them. For example, the system Oregano calls the system 
Basil once every two hours. If there's mail waiting for Oregano, 
Basil will send it at that time. Likewise, Oregano will at that 
time send any mail waiting for Basil.
    There are databases with connectivity information (UUCP maps), 
and programs (pathalias) that will help you decide the correct 
routing of messages. However, many UUCP hosts are not registered in 
the UUCP map. 
    EUNET is a UUCP based network in Europe. JUNET is an equivalent 
network in Japan.  There are many gateway machines that exchange 
mail between UUCP and the Internet. Among these, UUNET.UU.NET is 
among the most frequently used. 
 
Usenet
------
Usenet, Netnews, or just "News" are common terms for a large 
many-to-many conferencing (only) system distributed through UUCP, 
Internet, FidoNet, and BITNET. 
    This grassroots driven "network" has grown out of the global 
university and research domains. It is a service rather than a real 
network. It is not an organization, and has no central authority. 
    Usenet's newsgroups are carried by over 69,000 host computers 
in five continents, and has over 1,991,000 users (source: Brian 
Reid, 1993). Many of these hosts have access to the Internet. The 
European portion of Usenet is called EUNET (European Unix NET). 
    The local administrator of each individual node in the network 
decides what newsgroups to receive and make available to its users. 
Few systems offer access to all of them.
    NetNews is organized in groups of 'conferences'.  Each of these 
classifications is organized into groups and subgroups according to 
topic. As of June 1, 1993, there were 4500 newsgroups and 2500 
regional newsgroups. Several sites are carrying over 2600 topics.
   The groups distributed worldwide are divided into seven broad 
classifications: 

"comp"  Topics of interest to both computer professionals and 
        hobbyists, including topics in computer science, software
        source, and information on hardware and software systems.

"sci"   Discussions marked by special and usually practical 
        knowledge, relating to research in or application of the 
        established sciences.

"misc"  Groups addressing themes not easily classified under any 
        of the other headings or which incorporate themes from 
        multiple categories.

"soc"   Groups primarily addressing social issues and 
        socializing. 

"talk"  Groups largely debate-oriented and tending to feature 
        long discussions without resolution and without 
        appreciable amounts of generally useful information.

"news"  Groups concerned with the news network and software 
        themselves. 

"rec"   Groups oriented towards hobbies and recreational 
        activities. 

Also available are many "alternative" hierarchies, like:

"alt"   True anarchy; anything and everything can and does
        appear. Subjects include sex, and privacy.

"biz"   Business-related groups

Short takes about how to get started
====================================

* a computer
* modem and a communications program

You must have a computer
------------------------
It is not important what kind of computer you have, though you may 
find out that it is an advantage to have a popular one. The most 
common type of microcomputer today is called MS-DOS computers (or 
IBM PC compatibles or IBM clones). 
    Your computer should have enough memory for communication. This 
is seldom a problem. An MS-DOS computer with 256 KB RAM is enough 
when using popular programs like PROCOMM. 
    Your computer does not have to be very powerful and super fast, 
unless you want ultra fast transfers, use a slow communications 
program, or a complex system of script files. If this is the case, 
you'll know to appreciate speed and power. 
    You do not need a hard disk. Many do without. Not having one, 
however, means more work, and less room for storage of all the 
nice things that you may want to retrieve by modem. 
    Personally, I want as much hard disk space as I can possibly 
get. When you have read the book, I guess you'll understand why. 
    Others may want to delay the purchase of a hard disk until they 
can spare the money. If you can afford it, however, do it! It is a 
decision that you'll never regret. 

You must have a modem
---------------------
Some computers are always connected to a network. If this is your 
situation, then you probably have what you need already. The rest 
of us need a modem. 
    A modem is a small piece of equipment that is translating the 
internal, electrical signals of the computer to sound codes. These 
codes can be sent over an ordinary telephone line. You may think 
of it as a type of Morse alphabet. 
    The recipient of data also needs a modem. In his case, the sound 
codes will have to be translated back into their original form as 
digital codes. When this is done, he can view text and pictures on 
the screen, and use the received data in other applications. 
    You can buy modems on an expansion card for installation in 
your computer, or in a separate box. Often, a modem has already 
been built into the computer, when you buy it. 
    Whether to buy an internal or an external modem is a question 
of needs: 
    A portable computer with an internal modem is easier to bring 
on travels than an external modem with a modem cable and a power 
adapter. 
    An external modem can serve several computers. Some of them are 
so compact that they fit besides your toothbrush in the toilet bag. 
    An internal modem blocks one of your serial ports. 

External modems
---------------
The options are many. The modems differ on speed, features, prices 
- and whether they are approved for usage in your country. 
    Some of them are connected to the phone line by cable. Others 
are connected to the handset (to the talk and listen part) by two 
rubber cups. We call such modems acoustic modems (or acoustic 
couplers). 
    Acoustic modems are useful where connecting other modems to the 
telephone is difficult. The bad news is that you'll get more noise 
on the line. Acoustic modems can therefore not be recommended for 
use in other cases. 

Asynchronous or synchronous modems?
-----------------------------------
Formerly, data communication was done by sending job commands to a 
mainframe computer, and having the result returned in one batch. 
The modems were called synchronous. Such modems (and computers) are 
still in use in some large corporations. 
    Most of today's online services are based on an interactive 
dialog between the user and the remote computer. The user enters a 
command, for example a letter or a number in a menu, and the result
is returned almost immediately. The modems used for such work are 
called asynchronous (See "Explanation of some words and terms" in 
appendix 4). 
    Unless you know that you must have a synchronous modem, buy an 
asynchronous one. 

Choice of speed
---------------
Speed is measured in many ways. One method is to use baud. Another 
is to use characters per second (cps) or bits per second (bps). 
     Bps is a measure of how many data bits that can be transferred 
over a data channel in one second. (Each byte is split up into bits 
before transfer during serial communication.) 
    The relationship between baud and bits per second is complex, 
and often misused. Bits per second is unambiguous. In this book, 
we will use it as bps.
    We can estimate the number of characters per second by dividing 
the number of bps by ten. For example. 1200 bps is roughly 120 cps. 
    In 1987, 300, 1200 and 2400 bps asynchronous modems were the 
standard in many countries. Around 1990, the growth in 9600 bps 
modems and modem with faster speeds gained momentum. 
    Modem user manuals often give transfer speed by referring to 
some international classification codes. Here are some CCITT codes 
with explanation: 

V.21       0-300 bps        Still used by a small group. Cannot
           full duplex      communicate with the American Bell
                            103 standard. 

V.22       1200 bps         Partly compatible with the American
           full duplex      Bell 212a standard. Sometimes it 
                            works, sometimes it fails.

V.22bis    2400 bps         Used all over the world. Very
           full duplex      common.

V.23       600 &  1200      Rare protocol. Used mainly in Europe. 
           bps w/75         Half duplex.
           bps return ch.   

V.26ter    2400 bps         Used mainly in France
           full duplex

V.27ter    2400/4800 bps    Used in Group III fax
           half duplex

V.29       4800, 7200 and   Used in gr. III fax and in some (Ame-
           9600 bps         rican) modems. Do not buy V.29 if you
           half duplex      want a 9600 bps modem. 

V.32       4800/9600 bps    Current standard for 9600 bps modems
           full duplex      

V.32bis    4800/7200/9600,  Full duplex with faster interrogation.
           12000/14400 bps
           
V.34       14400 bps        A proposed high speed protocol that 
                            never made it. 

V.42                        Error correction protocol (an appendix
                            yields compatibility w/MNP gr. 2,3 and  
                            4 (see MNP below). For V.22, V.22bis,
                            V.26ter and V.32.

V.42bis                     Data compression for V.42 modems. 
                            Meant to replace MNP and LAP. Text can
                            be transferred three times faster than
                            with MNP, i.e., in up to 38400 bps
                            using a 9600 bps modem. Very common.

V.Fast                      Upcoming standard. If approved by
also called                 CCITT, it will support speeds to
V.32terbo                   28,800 bps for uncompressed data
                            transmission rates over regular dial-
                            up, voice-grade lines. Using V.42bis
                            data compression, up to 86,400 bps
                            may be achievable.

When you consider buying a modem with higher speed, remember that 
going from 1200 bps to 2400 is a 50 percent increase, while going 
from 1200 to 9600 bps gives 800 percent! 
    On the other hand, if you currently have 9600 bits/s, going to 
14.400 will only give you 50 percent. 

MNP error correction and compression
------------------------------------
The Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) is a U.S. industry standard 
for modem-to-modem communication with automatic error correction 
and compression. 
    Automatic error correction is useful when there is noise on the 
telephone line. MNP splits the stream of data up into blocks before 
transmission. They are checked by the other modem upon receipt. If 
the contents are correct, an acknowledge message is sent back to 
the sending modem. If there has been an error in the transmission, 
the sending modem is asked to retransmit. 
    When using compression, files are being preprocessed before 
transmission to decrease their size. The result is that the modem 
has to send fewer bytes, and the effect is higher speed. 
    MNP Level 3 and up send data between two modems synchronously 
rather than asynchronously. Since sending a start and stop bit with 
each transferred byte is no longer required, the effect is higher 
speed. 
    MNP-4 or higher have automatic adjustment of block length when 
there is noise on the line. If the line is good, longer blocks are 
sent. The block size is decreased if the line is bad causing many 
retransmissions. 
    MNP-5 has data compression. This gives a further increase in 
transfer speed by from 10 to 80 percent depending on the type of 
data sent. MNP-7 is capable of a three-to-one compression ratio. 
    Both users must have their modems set for MNP to use it. 

The speed of the computer's COMM port
-------------------------------------
Installing a super fast modem does not guarantee an increase in the 
effective transfer speed. The serial port of your computer may be a 
limiting factor. 
    Owners of older MS-DOS computers often have UARTs (serial port 
processors) in the Intel 8250 or National 16450 series. With these 
in the computer, it is difficult to achieve speeds above 9600 bps 
without losing data. 
    Take this into account when investing in a modem.

MNP and efficiency
------------------
I call my bulletin board daily. My personal computer is set to 
communicate with a V.32 modem at 19,000 bps. The modem sends data 
to the telephone line at 9600 bps, which is this modem's maximum 
line speed. 
    Data is received by the remote computer's V.32 modem at 9600 
bps, and forwarded to bulletin board at 19200 bps. 
    Why these differences in speed?
     MNP level 5 compresses data in the modem before transfer, and 
gives error-free transfer to and from the bulletin board at higher 
speed than by using 9600 bps all the way through. 
    The compression effectiveness differs by the type of data. When 
sending text, the effective transfer speed may double. Speed will 
increase further if the text contains long sequences of similar 
characters. 
    Text is typically compressed by up to 63 percent. This means 
that a 2400 bps modem using MNP-5 may obtain an effective speed of
around the double when transferring such data. 

File transfers using MNP
------------------------
Files are often compressed and stored in libraries before transfer. 
Online services do this because compressed files take less space on 
their hard disks. Also, it is easier for users to keep track of 
files sent in a library file. 
    You rarely get speed advantages when transferring precompressed 
files using MNP or V.42bis. With some modems, you must turn MNP and 
V.42bis compression off before retrieval of compressed files. 

Dumb or intelligent modem?
--------------------------
Some modems are operated with switches or buttons on a panel. They 
do not react to commands from your computer. We call them dumb.
    You must dial numbers manually, and press a key on the modem, 
when you hear the tone from a remote modem. Only when the modem is 
connected to the remote modem, can you ask your communications 
program to take over. 
    We call those modems 'intelligent' that can react to commands 
from your computer. Most of them react to commands according to the 
Hayes standard. 
    Buy intelligent, Hayes-compatible modems - even when other 
standards may seem better. Most of today's communication programs 
are designed to be used by such modems. 

    Note: Buy modems that use the Hayes extended command set.

When a popular communications program, like Procomm and Crosstalk, 
tells the modem to "dial a number" or "go on hook," then the Hayes-
compatible modem will do just that. 
    When you press ALT-H in Procomm, the modem will disconnect from 
the remote modem. 
    If you press ALT-D followed by the number "2," Procomm will 
locate the number to an online service in your telephone directory, 
and dial that number. 
    When the connection with the remote modem has been established, 
your modem will report back to you with a message like CONNECT 
2400. This tells that a connection has been set up at 2400 bps. 
    If I select "k" from a menu provided by my communications 
program's command scripts, then my system will retrieve today's 
business news from Tokyo and put them up on my screen. 
    In the process, my system tells the modem to do several things, 
including "call a number," "speed 2400 bps," "redial if busy," "go 
on-hook when done." The only thing that I have to do, is press "k". 
The communications program and the modem will do the rest. 
    Automatic communication is impossible without an intelligent 
modem. 

The Hayes standard
------------------
The U.S. company Hayes Microcomputer Products, Inc. pioneered 
command-driven modems. Their Smartmodem became a success, and 
"Hayes compatibility" a standard for intelligent modems. 
    Today, it is as unimportant to buy a Hayes modem to get access 
to Hayes commands, as to buy an IBM PC to run PC software. 
    Automatic dialing (autodial) was one of Smartmodem's important 
features. The modem could call a number and prepare for data
communication, once a connection had been set up. If the line was 
busy, it could wait a while and then redial. The operator could 
work with other things while waiting for the equipment to be ready 
for communication. 
    The modem had automatic answer (autoanswer), i.e., when someone 
called in, the modem could take the phone off hook and set up a 
connection with a remote modem. The modem enabled a connected PC to 
act as an electronic answering machine.
    Hayes-compatible modems can report call progress to the local 
screen using short numeric codes or words like CONNECT, CONNECT 
1200, CONNECT 2400, NO CARRIER, NO DIALTONE, BUSY, NO ANSWER, RING 
etc. 
    There can be small differences between such modems. The message 
DIALTONE on one modem may be DIAL TONE on another. Most of the main
progress messages, however, are the same across brands. 
    The old Smartmodem had switches used to configure the modem. 
Most modern Hayes-compatible modems come without switches and have 
more commands than their ancestor. 
    Today's Hayes-compatible modems have a core of common commands, 
the "real" Hayes-commands, and several unstandardized additional 
commands. Here is an example: 

A standard on the move
----------------------
On the Quattro SB2422 modem, 2400 bps speed without automatic speed 
detection is set by the command "AT&I1." The equivalent command on 
Semafor's UniMod 4161 is "AT+C0". 
    Automatic detection of speed is a feature that lets the modem 
discover the speed of the remote modem to set its own speed at the 
same level. (Other modems may use different commands to set this.) 
    When I want Procomm to call a bulletin board, it first sends a 
sequence of Hayes commands to the Semafor modem. The purpose is to 
"configure" the modem before calling. It sends the following: 

      AT S0=0 +C0 S7=40 S9=4 &D2

The cryptic codes have the following meaning:

   AT              "Attention modem. Commands following.."
   S0=0            No automatic answer 
   +C0             No automatic speed detection (fixed speed) 
   S7=40           Wait 40 seconds for an answer tone from the
                   remote modem. 
   S9=4            Wait 4/10 seconds for detection of carrier
   &D2             Go on-hook if the DTR signal is being changed.

If this command is sent to the Quattro modem, it will reply with 
"ERROR". The code "+C0" must be replaced with an "&I1". The rest 
of the commands are the same. (Note: when a modem responds with 
"ERROR," it has usually rejected all commands sent to it!) 
    This setup is held in the modem's memory when Procomm sends its 
dialing command: ATDT4737031378. AT stands for ATtention, as above. 
DT stands for Dial Tone. Here, it is used to dial the number 
4737031378 using tone signaling (rather than pulse dialing). 

The modem cable
---------------
If you have an external modem, you must connect your computer to 
the modem with a cable. Some modems are sold without a cable. 
    This cable may be called a serial cable, a modem cable, a 
RS232C cable, or something else. Make sure that you buy the 
correct cable for your system. 
    Make sure that the connectors at each end of the cable are 
correct. If a male connector (with pins) is required in one end and 
a female (with holes) in the other, do not buy a cable with two 
male connectors. 
    Some connectors have 9 pins/holes, while others have 25 or 8-
pin round plugs (Apple computers). Use a shielded cable to ensure 
minimal interference with radio and television reception. 
    At this point, some discover that there is no place on the PC 
to attach the cable. Look for a serial port at the rear of your 
machine, labeled MODEM, COMMUNICATIONS, SERIAL, or with a phone 
symbol. 
   If you find no suitable connector, you may have to install an 
asynchronous communication port in the box. 

Connecting your equipment to earth
----------------------------------
Secure your computer and modem against thunderstorms and other 
electrical problems. Securing the electric outlet in the wall is 
not enough. Problems can also enter through the telephone line. 
    Thunderstorms have sent electrical pulses through the telephone 
line destroying four modems, three PC-fax cards, one mother board, 
and at least one asynchronous communication port. 
    To prevent this from happening to you, disconnect electrical 
and telephone cables from your equipment during thunderstorms. 

The communications program
--------------------------
A powerful communications program is half the job. In my case it's 
the whole job. Most of my work is done automatically.
    The communications program will help you with the mechanical 
transportation of data in both directions. It lets you store 
incoming information for later use and reduces the risks of errors. 
    Here are some items to consider when shopping communications 
program:
    * Seriously consider buying automatic programs ('robots') for 
access to individual online services, even if that means having to 
use several programs for different applications. (Read chapter 16 
for more details.) 
    * Menus and help texts are important for novices, and in 
environments with "less motivated personnel." Advanced users may 
find it boring. 
    * Ability to transfer data without errors. The program should 
have transfer protocols like XMODEM, Kermit, XMODEM/CRC, YMODEM and 
ZMODEM. The XMODEM protocol is the most commonly used. You need 
these protocols if you want to transfer compiled computer programs 
(e.g., .COM and .EXE files). They are also used when transferring 
compressed files, graphics and music files.
    * Does it let you tailor it to your taste/needs? Some programs 
let you attach batches of commands to function keys and keypress 
combinations. For example, by having your computer call your 
favorite online service by pressing the F1 key. 
    * Does it let you "scroll back" information having disappeared 
out of your screen? This may be useful when you want to respond 
while online to an electronic mail message. The sender's address 
and name, which you need to respond, have scrolled off the screen. 
If you cannot review the "lost" information, you may have to 
disconnect and call back later to send your mail. 

Connecting to the online service
--------------------------------
The first couple of times, most people think that it is very 
difficult. Soon it becomes a simple routine. 
     On some computers, you just press a key, and that's it. On 
others, you have to call and press, and watch, while things are 
happening. Cheap is often a synonym for more work. 
    If you have a dumb modem connected to your personal computer, 
these are the typical steps that you must take:

    (1) Start your communications program and set it up, e.g., with
       2400 bps, 8 bits word length, 1 stop bit, no parity. (This
       is the most common setup.) Then set the program to "online."
    (2) Call the number (e.g., +47 370 31378)
    (3) When you hear the tone from the remote modem in the phone,
       press DATA to get the modems to connect to each other
       (i.e., to start to "handshake").
    (4) A front panel indicator may tell you when the connection
       has been set up. You can start transferring data.

With an MS-DOS computer, an automatic modem and a powerful program 
preset for the job, the steps may be as follows: 

    (1) Start the program and display the telephone directory.
       Select a service from the list by pressing a number.
    (2) The modem will call automatically to the service. When
       CONNECT has been established, your user identification and
       password are sent at the prompts for such information. When
       this is done, you are free to take control.

With an MS-DOS computer, TAPCIS, and an intelligent modem, you 
start by selecting forums and services to access on CompuServe. 
Enter 'o' to upload and download programs, or 'n' to have it fetch 
new message headers and messages. 
    TAPCIS will dial the number, do the job, and tell you when it's 
done. Meanwhile, you can go out to look at the moon, or sing a 
song. 

Getting started with Procomm
----------------------------
Procomm is cheap and probably the most commonly used communications 
program for MS-DOS computers. It's been like this for many years, 
though there are many better and cheaper alternatives.
    An older version of the program (version 2.4.2) is still being 
distributed through bulletin boards all over the world. You may 
give copies of this version to anyone. The requirement is that you 
pay a contribution of US$25 to the vendor if you like it and start 
to use it.  
    Procomm is simple for novices, can automate the work for 
advanced users and be run on almost any MS-DOS computer. Here is
some of the features:
    Press ALT-F10 for a pull-down window text listing features and 
commands. Press ALT+D to call a number, update the telephone 
directory, or select a script file for autologon to a service. 
    Procomm can emulate (pretend to be) different terminal types, 
like IBM 3101 and DEC VT-100/VT-52. Most services covered in this 
book may be well served with the setting ANSI.BBS. 
    It let you use both dumb and intelligent Hayes-compatible 
modems. If you have the latter, select numbers from the telephone 
directory for autologon. If the number is busy, Procomm can call 
back until you can get through. 
    You can define macros to automate your work. You can have one 
keystroke send your user identification, another for your password, 
and a third key to send a sequence of commands. Macros make your 
communication faster and safer. 
    You can write script files to automate the online work further. 
You can transfer text files and binary files using automatic error 
detection/correction protocols, like XMODEM, YMODEM, Telink and 
Kermit, at speeds from 300 to 19200 bps. Adding external protocols 
like ZMODEM is relatively simple.

The first thing novices want to know is how to set up the modem 
and computer for communication. This may take more time than 
expected and often seems complex for the uninitiated. You can save 
yourself much sweat and frustration by asking others for help. 
    To set up your equipment for communication is a one time job.
Once done, you can almost forget what you did and why. 
    There are so many different modems, computers and programs out 
there. We just cannot give practical advice on the use of all of 
them in one short appendix. Instead, we will use one example. Your 
job is to "translate" the text into a terminology that fits your 
tools. 
    Once your system is set up for communication, your first job 
will be to find what keys to press to get the job done. How you use 
your communications program may vary considerably from our example. 
In general, however, it will be the same for most people doing 
manual communication. Once online, the environment is the same for 
all users. 
    If you plan to use automatic communications as explained in 
chapter 16, this chapter may not be that important. Your program 
will do the job for you. Still, take a few minutes and browse 
through the text. It may enable you to handle unexpected problems 
better. 
    Our example assumes that you have an MS-DOS computer. Not 
because this is the best microcomputer in the world, but because 
there are more of them than anything else. We assume that you 
have an external, intelligent Hayes-compatible modem and the 
communications program Procomm (version 2.4.2). 
    In this example, your modem is tested by calling my bulletin 
board at +47 370 31378. Not because this is the best board in the 
world, but because I have full control over how it looks and feels 
for those using it. 

Assembling the equipment
------------------------
You have the modem, the cable (to connect your modem with the 
computer), a phone cable (to connect your modem with the phone or 
the wall jack), and a communications program. 
    Check that the modem's power switch is off. Place the modem by 
the computer, and plug the power supply cord (or the power adapter 
cord) into the AC wall socket. Switch on the modem. 

    Do NOT use 115-volt equipment in 250-volt sockets! 

Connect modem and computer using the modem cable. There may be 
several optional sockets on the computer. These are usually marked 
RS-232, COMMS, MODEM, or just nothing. The connector may be of a 
flat 25-pins, 9 pins, or a round 8-pins type. Use communication 
port number 1, 2, or whatever else is available for this purpose.
    If you have several options, and the socket for communication 
port number 1 seems free, use this. If not, try one of the others. 
    Next, connect the modem to the telephone line. If in luck, the 
modem came with a phone cable that works with your setup. If so, it 
is simple: 
    1. Disconnect the phone cable from the telephone. Insert the 
modular plug into the right jack on the modem. This jack is often 
marked with the word LINE, with a drawing of a modular wall jack, 
or another understandable icon. 
    2. You may be able to connect the phone to the modem using the 
phone cord that came with the modem. This may allow you to use the 
phone for voice, when the line is not busy with communication. (You 
may have to make changes in this cord to make it work with the 
connected phone.) 
    This concludes the technical assembly of your equipment. Next 
step is to install the communications program. When this is done, 
we will check it out. 

Installing the program
----------------------
Let us assume that you have received Procomm on a diskette, and 
that it is set up with its default configuration. PROCOMM.EXE is 
the program. The other files have no importance here. 
    Enter Procomm and press ENTER. Our first task is to prepare it 
for communication: 
    If you are using a monochrome display, use the command 

    PROCOMM /B

The program will greet you by a welcome text. At the bottom of the 
screen, the message "CREATING SYSTEM FILES" may appear (if these 
have not been created yet), followed by a message from the creators 
of the program. 
    Press ENTER when you have read the text. The screen will be 
blanked, and a text line will appear at the bottom. 
    Now is the time to test if the technical installation has been 
successful. 

The dial tone
-------------
Lift the receiver from the phone and check if you can hear the dial 
tone. If you can, turn the pages to "Does the computer have contact 
with the modem?" 
    If you hear nothing, there are several possible causes:
    * The phone is not working. This is easily checked. Disconnect 
it from the modem, and connect it to the wall (using the original 
cable!). If you get a dial tone now, then the phone is in order. 
    * The cable between the modem and the wall jack may be broken, 
or wrongly configured. To check this, we must first check the 
connection between the modem and the computer. 
    Once we know that the connection between the modem and the 
computer is in order, we can use the modem to check our phone 
cable. 
    * The cable between the modem and the phone may be in disorder. 
For example, the modular phone connector may have a cabling that 
differs from what is assumed in your country. If there is no dial 
tone, then the cable between the modem and the telephone must be 
repaired, or replaced. 

Does your computer have contact with the modem?
-----------------------------------------------
When you first use Procomm, it is preset for communication at 300 
bps, use of port 1 and ANSI-BBS. (The control line at the bottom of 
your screen should read: ALT-F10 HELP, ANSI-BBS, HDX, 300 N81, LOG 
CLOSED, PRT OFF, CR and CR.) 
    * If your modem is unable to communicate at 300 bps, you must
change the setup. Press ALT-P (keep the ALT key down while pressing 
P) to get the menu LINE SETTINGS. Choice 9 gives 2400 bps with 8 
bits word length, no parity and one stop bit. This is a common 
setting. Select 24 "Save changes" to make the setting permanent. 
    * If you know that your modem is not connected to the 
computer's port number 1, then change this from the same menu. 
Choice 21 gives COM2, and choice 22 gives COM3. 
    If you don't know what communication port the modem has been 
connected to, you have to find out by testing. Do this by entering 
(i.e., sending to the modem) the characters AT. Now, the modem is 
supposed to respond with an OK (or with the number "0," if the 
modem is set to reply with numeric codes). 
    If you get an "OK" or a "0" on your display, continue reading 
from "Does the modem have contact with the phone line?" 
    If you can see "AT" on your screen while you enter it, you have 
contact with the modem. This is true even if it does not send any 
confirmation. The modem may have been instructed not to confirm. If 
you see the AT characters, read from "Does the modem have contact 
with the phone line?" 
    If there is no contact between the modem and the computer, the 
screen will remain blank at all times. Your problem may be the 
cable, your choice of modem port, or the modem setup. 
    First, check if the modem is switched on (the power switch), 
and that the plugs are firmly in the jacks. 
    Then let's check the modem. It may have been set not to respond 
to your commands. Let's try to change that. Enter the following 
command, and press ENTER: 

    ATQ0E1V1

This should make your modem: give result codes on your screen (Q0), 
show the characters that you enter (E1), and use OK instead of the 
numerical result code 0 (V1). 
    If you still get no OK, the reason may still be in the modem. I 
have seen modems get "indigestion problems" when too many commands 
are given to them. 
    Try give a command to return it to its factory setting. This 
command is not the same on all Hayes-compatible modems. On most of 
them, you can use one of the following: AT&F, ATF or ATZ (on some 
modems ATZ is used to reset to the stored configuration). Locate 
the correct command to use in the modem's user manual. Then, try 
ATQ0E1V1 again. 
    If you are still without success, check your choice of modem 
port. If there are several communication connectors at the back of 
your computer, test these. If this doesn't help, connect the modem 
cable to the most probable jack. 
    Now, test the communication port for a response from the modem 
using another communications program setting. Press ALT-P, select 
another port (choice 20 - 23), press ESC and try "AT" again (or 
ATQ0E1V1). If there is still no reaction, test the computer's other 
communications connectors. 

    If you have a mouse connected to your computers, make sure
    that it is not using the same port as your communications
    program.

    Problems with the communications port are often caused by other 
    equipment. Remove all extra equipment (like a PC-fax card or a 
    mouse), and all associated software (often represented by a 
    line starting with "DRIVER=" in CONFIG.SYS, or a resident 
    program driving a mouse). Remove all resident programs from 
    memory before testing. 

If you are still at the same unfortunate stage, chances are that 
the problem is either in the cable or the modem. If you know others 
who are into data communication, visit them for help. Bring your 
cable and your modem to have them tested in an environment where 
things work. It is easier to isolate a problem by testing your 
units in sequence on your helper's system. 
    First, the cable. Connect it between his computer and his 
modem. Test the connection to his modem with your cable as the only 
foreign element. If the test is successful, your cable is OK. 
    Next, the modem. If the test is successful, your modem is in 
order. The most probable cause of your problems is your computer's 
communications port. 

    In communications, many parts have to work together. You may 
    have problems with more than one of them at the same time. The 
    rule is to test step by step to eliminate possible problems. 

If you get no reply from your modem, when it is connected to your 
friend's computer, chances are that it needs to be repaired. Call 
the seller for help. 
    A last refuge is to buy an extra communications card for your 
computer . . . 

Does your modem have contact with the phone line?
-------------------------------------------------
You have contact between your computer and modem. The modem answers 
"OK" as assumed. We now have to test if there is contact with the 
phone line. That is easy.
    Enter the following command and press ENTER:

    ATQ0E1V1

When the modem answers OK, enter the dialing command: 

    ATDT37031378

The modem will try to call 37031378, the number to my BBS. (You may 
have to prefix the number with an international code, and the 
country code for Norway. If international calls require the prefix 
009, enter ATDT009-47-37031378). 
    Your modem will wait for CONNECT a preset number of seconds 
(rarely longer than 60 seconds). 
    If your modem does not detect the dial tone (within the preset 
waiting time), it will give you the following error message

    NO DIALTONE

All other messages (except ERROR) declare that the modem did detect 
the dial tone. If it did, continue reading from "Configuring your 
program." 

NO DIALTONE
-----------
The most probable causes of NO DIALTONE are that your phone cable 
is not connected, that it has been damaged, or that it is the wrong 
cable for the job. 
    The latter cause is common in many countries. For example, a 
cable made for a telephone network in the United States, may not 
work in Norway. A cable made for connection to a switchboard, may 
not work when connected to a domestic phone line. 
    A standard, domestic American phone cable contains four lines. 
Two of these (line number 1 and 4) carry sounds. The others are not 
being used. A standard Norwegian domestic cable is set up in the 
same way, but here line number 1 and 3 carry sound. 
    Changing the configuration of such cables is often simple. Just 
cut the cable in two, and put the lines together correctly. This is 
typically required when your modem assumes that you use it in North 
America, while you are in a country with different cabling. 

Configuring your program
------------------------
The modem answers. The dial tone is being detected. Procomm is 
installed on your hard disk. Now, check if the program has been 
correctly configured. 
    Press ALT-S to get the Setup Menu. Select 1, Modem setup, from 
this menu. 
    Choice 1, Modem init string, is a general setup command. This 
command will be sent to the modem each time you start Procomm. You 
are free to make is as long and powerful as you want. Our purpose 
now, however, is to check if it works. 

    Most modems do not react if one element in your setup command 
    is wrong. They respond with ERROR (or the numeric code), and 
    disregard the rest. 

Procomm's standard Modem init string has the following commands: 

    ATE0 S7=60 S11=55 V1 X1 S0=0!

These work well with most modems, provided the speed is legal. 
    Go back to the blank screen (using ESC). Test the init command 
by entering it manually. (Do not enter the "!" character. This is 
Procomm's code for ENTER.) 
    If the modem reacts with ERROR, check with the modem manual to 
find out what is wrong. (Check if the values S7=60 and S11=55 are 
not too high.) 
    If you have to change the init command, go back to the Modem 
init string menu choice. Enter the correct commands. Remember to 
add the "!" at the end. 
    Press ESC to get to the main configuration menu and select 2, 
TERMINAL SETUP.  Check if Terminal emulation is ANSI-BBS. Change 
choice 2, Duplex, to FULL. The other factory settings are NONE, CR, 
CR, DEST, BS, OFF, ON, 350, OFF. 
    Return to the SETUP MENU (press ESC). Press "s" to save the 
setup to disk. Your setting has now been stored, and Procomm is 
ready to be used. 

Dialing
-------
Now, test your setup by calling your favorite online service. We 
will show how to log on to my bulletin board. 
    You can call manually by entering ATDT followed by the phone 
number. The most practical method, however, is to use the built-in 
phone directory. 
    Press ALT-D to get to the phone directory. Press "R" to revise 
the list, and enter Saltrod Horror Show somewhere on the list. I 
have it as number 2. Answer the questions like this:


    Name: Saltrod Horror Show
    Number: 009-47-370-31378
    Baud: 9600
    Parity: N
    Databits: 8
    Stop Bits: 1
    Echo On? N
    Command file: (press ENTER, meaning that you don't want to
                   use a script file at this point)

Baud can be anything from 300 bps to 9600 bps. It's up to you, and 
depends on your modem's capabilities. 
    When done, enter "2" and press ENTER. The modem will dial the 
number (that you have as item 2 on the list), and try to connect. 
    If the number is busy, you will get a warning. You can now 
leave Procomm (ALT+X), or set it for redialing (ALT+R). When set 
for redialing, Procomm will call back until a connection has been 
made. When CONNECT is received from your modem, Procomm announces 
the fact with a beep in the computer's loudspeaker. 
    Text will start scrolling over your screen. First, a short 
welcome text pops up. Your interactive dialog with the bulletin 
board can start. 
    The first question is "What is your First Name?" Enter your 
first name. Then, "What is your Last Name?"  Enter your last name. 
    Your dialog with the remote computer will continue like this. 
The board will ask you questions, and you will enter your answers. 

What may go wrong?
------------------
A setting that works beautifully when calling one bulletin board, 
may be a disaster when calling another service. Here are some 
typical problems: 

When dialing through a switchboard (PBX).
-----------------------------------------
Remember to add 9 or 0 for a city line, when dialing out from a 
PBX. If you forget, you'll get nowhere. 
    Use the following command (assuming that you must enter 0 to 
get a city line, and use tone signaling): 

    ATDT0W4737031378

If you must use 9 for a city line and pulse dialing, use the 
following command 

    ATDP9W4737031378

Register your standard dialing command in Procomm's MODEM SETUP. 
Enter ALT+S and then select 1, Modem Setup. Choice 2, Dialing 
command. The default entry is ATDT. Replace this with ATDT0W, 
ATDP9W or whatever makes dialing work for you. 

No answer from the remote computer
----------------------------------
Your computer has to "talk the same language" as the remote host.
If the parameters of your communications program have been set 
incorrectly, it may be impossible to set up a connection with the 
service. 
    Sometimes, you get CONNECT, but your screen only gives you 
strange, unintelligible 'noise' characters. The reason may be 
CONNECT at an incompatible speed, a service's use of special codes 
for displaying text (including special language characters), or 
that the service requires use of a special communications program 
or method (as when a service starts by interrogating for the use of 
an offline reader). 
    Many online services require that you use certain settings. 
Most services, however, may be reached when using the following: 

    Speed: 2400 bps
    8 bits word length, no parity, one stop bit

Some services (notably some Unix hosts) demand 7 bits, even parity, 
one stop bit. 

Sorry, no luck!
---------------
Try again, just in case. The remote computer may have had a 
temporary problem, when you called. The PTT may have given you a 
particularly noisy telephone line on this attempt. 
    If this doesn't help, recheck each point in the communications 
process. It is so easy to do something wrong. 
    If nothing helps, read the service's user information manuals. 
Only rarely will you be able to blame the communications program 
(unless you have made it yourself), or the equipment. Most errors 
are caused by finger trouble and misunderstandings. 

Testing the Saltrod Horror Show
-------------------------------
First time visitors often experience problems, and in particular if 
this is their first time online using a Hayes-compatible modem. 
    Here are some typical problems with suggested solutions:

    * Disable Guard Tones from the modem when dialing. If it has 
this feature, you can often turn it off. Put the required command 
in your Modem init string. 
    * Don't press ENTER to "wake" my system. The software will 
automatically detect your speed and adjust accordingly. The same 
applies for many services. On some, you're just asking for problems 
by not waiting patiently (often the case when the remote software 
starts by checking if you use an offline reader). 
    * My BBS accepts from 300 to 9600 bps asynchronous, full duplex 
communication. You may not succeed with 1200 bps half duplex, Bell 
300 bps or 1200 bps. 
    * Start with your communications program set for 8 bits word 
length, no parity and one stop bit. Try 7 bits, even parity if 
there is too much noise on the line (you cannot retrieve programs 
using this setting, though). 
    * When your modem is set at a low transfer speed, it may not 
wait long enough for carrier from my modem. Most modems let you 
set this waiting time longer by giving a value to a S-register. 
(Read in your modem's manual about how to do this). 

Partial success
---------------
Some bulletin boards offer colors and music. If your equipment is 
set up correctly, you can receive the welcome text in full color 
graphics accompanied by a melody in your computer's speaker. 
    If it is not, chances are that you will get many strange codes 
on your screen, and an ugly feeling that something is wrong. 
    There are two ways out of this problem:
    1. Ask the bulletin board to send text only (select U for 
Utilities, and then G for Graphics to change setting),
    2. Set your computer for colors and graphics. This feature is 
only available for callers with an MS-DOS computers. You may need 
to add the line DEVICE=ANSI.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS. 
    Finally, you must have a communications program that allows you 
to display colors on your screen. Procomm set with ANSI-BBS does 
that. 

Downloading programs
--------------------
We call the transfer of programs and files from a remote computer 
for downloading. It means "transfer of data to your computer AND 
storage of the data (down) on YOUR local disk." 
    You are downloading, when you call my board to retrieve a 
program. 
    When you, overwhelmed by gratitude, send one of your favorite 
programs TO my bulletin board, then we call it uploading. 
    Data can be many things. It may be news from Washington Post, a 
digital picture, an executable program, a pile of invoices, a piece 
of music, a voice file, an animated sequence of pictures and music, 
or compressed library files.
    Downloading "plain text" (also called "plain ASCII" or "DOS 
text" on MS-DOS machines) is relatively easy. Such text usually
only contains characters between number 32 (space character) and 
126 (the ~ character) in the ASCII table.
    Characters with lower numbers have special functions (like the
control characters ESCape and CTRL+C). These may not even be 
displayed on your screen. Characters with higher numbers are used 
for graphics, special national characters, and other applications. 
    Special transfer methods are often required, when your data 
contains text with characters outside ASCII number 32 through 126. 
Read under "Protocol transfers" below for more information about 
how to do this. 

Downloading text
----------------
Most communication programs require that you begin by opening a 
file. They ask you to enter a file name. From this point and 
onwards all incoming text will be stored in this file until you say 
stop. 
    Communication programs do this in different ways. Some let 
incoming data flow through a temporary storage area using the 
principle first in, first out. When you open a file, it starts 
storing data from the beginning of the temporary storage area, 
though this text may have scrolled off your screen some time ago. 
    Most communication programs start storing data from NOW. 
Procomm works this way. You start downloading of text by pressing 
the PgDn key. A window will appear on your screen giving you a 
choice between various methods. Select ASCII. 
    In another window, you are asked to enter a file name. When 
done, storage of incoming data starts. You stop the process by 
pressing the ESC key. 
    Procomm has another method called "file logging." You start 
this by pressing ALT-F1. Procomm requests the file name, and the 
storage process starts. (Read under "Strip" about the difference 
between these methods.) 

    If you forget to tell Procomm to store incoming data, then 
    you will most probably lose this data for ever.

    Do not waste time and money by forgetting to store what you
    receive!

The term "append"
-----------------
When downloading text - or anything - it is important to know 
whether you are appending information to an existing file, or 
overwriting it (i.e., destroying the old text). 
    Most communication programs complain with an audible signal, 
when you try to overwrite an existing file. They will ask you if 
you really want to delete it, or append the current data.

The term "strip"
----------------
The purpose of 'strip' is to remove something from incoming data or 
to change it on the fly. 
    When you use ASCII downloading with Procomm, ALL incoming data 
are being stored. This includes so-called ESCape sequences. If you 
use File Logging, all control characters (except the line feed and 
new page characters) are being removed (filtered). 
    If you download text from a computer that uses other ASCII 
characters for linefeed and return, save time by having the 
communications program convert them on the fly to their correct 
form for your computer. 
    You define strip procedures through Procomm's SetUp menu (ALT-
S). You can also request automatic conversion of characters to 
graphics values, or local language variants. 

National characters
-------------------
Special national characters cause problems in many countries. One 
reason is that they are represented by different internal codes on 
various hardware platforms, and that some networks are unable to 
transmit 8-bits data. 
    Some systems represent these special characters by a 7-bit 
code, others by an 8-bit code. Some depend on the computer having 
an internal national language ROM, or that it uses a special 
(resident) conversion program. 
    What gives good results on an MS-DOS computer, may give rubbish 
on a Macintosh, Amiga, Atari, or a PC using MS Windows. 
    Many communication programs have features that can help you 
solve at least some these problems. They let you make translation 
tables for automatic conversion of special incoming and outgoing 
characters. 
    If you call a Scandinavian online service using 7 bits even 
parity, many transfer the national special characters using the 
ASCII code equivalents of number 91, 92, 93, 123, 124, and 125. 
Similar, more or less formal standards are in place in other 
countries. 

Protocol transfers
------------------
If your purpose is to transfer digitized pictures, a computer 
program, a batch of invoices, a piece of music or an animated 
sequence of pictures, it's important that each character (bit) 
arrives correctly. We achieve this by using protocol transfers. 
    These files often contain control or binary characters. You 
cannot transfer binary files without the use of special methods.
    It is easy to understand why we need protocol transfers when 
retrieving plain text as tables of numbers, statistics, and 
financial reports. Transfer errors may have fatal consequences. 
    Protocol transfers are also required when transferring word 
processor text files having imbedded control codes (like text made 
with WordPerfect), and compressed files. 
    Here is an example:

Downloading public domain software
----------------------------------
First, you need the names and features of the programs that can be 
downloaded from a service. On most bulletin boards, you must enter 
a command to navigate to the File Library. Here, they normally 
greet you with a menu listing available commands. 

    Try H (for Help!) or ? when you are stuck.

Public domain and shareware programs are stored in subdirectories 
on my bulletin board. The directories have numerical names. Utility 
programs for MS-DOS computers are stored in directory 10. Games are 
stored in directory 17.
    Enter L for a list of available directories (other bulletin 
boards may use different commands). Enter "L 17" to list the files 
in directory 17. This will give file names, lengths in characters 
(to help you estimate download time), creation dates, and a short 
description of each file. 
    You can search for files of interest. When looking for programs 
that can help you get more out of a printer, you may search using 
keywords like "printer." 
    Some programs are made available in text form. This is the case 
with older BASIC programs. (The file name extensions .BAS, .ASC or 
.TXT suggest that the files contain plain text.)  You can download 
these files using ASCII. 
    Most programs are stored in their executable form, or as one 
executable file among several in a compressed transfer file (a 
library of files). On my board, most of these files have the file 
name extension .EXE or .COM. 
    What transfer protocol to use, depends on what is available in 
your communications program. 

The protocol transfer method explained
--------------------------------------
The protocol transfer algorithms use methods to check the transfer 
with automatic error correction. In principle, they work like this: 
    The sending program calculates a check sum based on the 
contents of the file. The receiving program does the same 
calculation and compares the result with the senders' check sum. If 
the figures match, the transfer was successful. If not, all or part 
of the file will be retransmitted. 
    These are some popular protocols:

XMODEM
------
has automatic error detection and correction. Most modern programs 
have this feature. XMODEM exists in programs for MS-DOS computers, 
CP/M computers, Apple, TRS-80 Model 100, etc. It is the most 
commonly used transfer protocol. 
    XMODEM assumes 8-bit settings in your communications program. 
The file to be sent is split up into 128 bit sized blocks (or 
"packets") before transfer. The sender calculates the check sum and 
adds a check sum bit at the end of each packet. (Packing, sending 
and checking is done automatically by the software.) 
    The receiving program calculates its own check sum and compares 
with the sender's. If an error is detected, XMODEM will request 
retransmission of the last block. 
    XMODEM is reasonably good when there is little noise on the 
telephone line is low. When the line is bad, however, there is 
always a chance that the transfer will stop. You cannot use XMODEM 
on computer networks that use ASCII flow control or ESCape codes. 
    The transfer commands must be given to both computers. You can 
only transfer one file per command.
    XMODEM's "packet size" (block length) is short. This has an 
impact on transfer speed, and especially when downloading from 
timesharing systems, packet switched networks, via satellites, and 
when using buffered (error correcting) modems. 
    The control method (8-bit check sum) and unprotected 
transactions give a low level of safety against errors in the 
transmission. The transferred file may contain 127 bytes with noise 
characters (at the end). The creation date of the file is lost in 
the transfer. 
    These weaknesses have given us better methods. Here are some of 
them:

XMODEM/CRC
----------
CRC is an abbreviation for Cyclical Redundancy Check. The method 
guarantees 99.9969 percent free transfer. It still has the other 
weaknesses of ordinary XMODEM transfers. 

YMODEM Batch
------------
is faster than XMODEM and gives a high level of safety in the 
transfers. When used with some programs, YMODEM can transfer the 
files' creation time/date. You can transfer updated documents. This 
will replace documents with an older creation date. Only one party 
must enter the file name. YMODEM takes care of the rest. 

Kermit
------
is used on many computer platforms, and especially where they use a 
terminal emulation mode (like VT-100) which makes the use of XMODEM 
impossible. Kermit is one of the few asynchronous error correction 
protocols that functions well when exchanging files having half 
duplex IBM front-end machines. 
    Kermit can transfer more than one file at the time.

Super-Kermit
------------
is also called Kermit with Sliding Windows. It can transfer many 
packets before stopping to check the transfer. The protocol is 
much faster than XMODEM.

ZMODEM
------
is currently the fastest transfer protocol for many applications. 
All transactions are protected with a 16-bit or 32-bit CRC. ZMODEM 
is immune against most error conditions that prevent traditional 
protocols to achieve correct transfer.
    ZMODEM transfers the creation date of the file and its exact 
contents. The file name is read once, and all transfer commands may 
be given by the sending program. 

Decompression of files
----------------------
If a file has name extensions like ZIP, LZH, ARC, PAK, LQR, LBR, 
ZOO, ARJ, or QQQ, you are facing a compressed file. We use such 
files to achieve faster transfers.
    Files having the extension .EXE or .COM may be compressed files 
that have been converted into a self-extract format. To retrieve 
the files from a self-extract compressed file, just enter the 
file's name. 
    To decompress files that have not been made self-extract, 
you need a utility program. These programs have many names and are 
available through most bulletin boards. 

Transfer problems
-----------------
Most transfer problems are caused by the communication programs 
and their (lack of) features. 
    Some Procomm users have problems with the Kermit protocol. Tip: 
use 8 bit world length and no parity in your program setup. 7 bits 
and even parity does not always work (on version 2.4.2).

Uploading
---------
The transfer of data "the other way," i.e., from your disk to a 
remote computer, requires that you start by making some decisions. 
Is the file to be sent as plain ASCII? Should I compress it in a 
distribution file to reduce transfer time, and make it easier to 
handle for the recipient? 
    If you are transferring a text file containing special national 
characters, then these may have to be converted to another format. 
    If your text contains blank lines (like blank lines between 
paragraphs), you may have to insert a space character at the start 
of all such lines. Some systems interpret a blank line as a signal 
telling that transmission is done. The invisible space character 
prevents this. 
    Some hosts have limitations on line length. They may require 
that lines be shorter than 80 characters. If you send lines that 
are too long, the result may be fatal. 

Sending electronic mail
-----------------------
If you send your mail too fast, some online services tend to get 
digestion problems. You must be very accurate with the format of 
your message. It has to agree with the host machine's rules about 
line length, and maximum number of lines per message. 
    Let's assume that you want to send the following message to an 
electronic mailbox:

    To: Datatid
    cc: Anne-Tove Vestfossen
    Sj: Merry Christmas!
    Text: Thanks for the box with herring. The taste was 
    formidable. etc .. etc... etc...
    Greetings, Odd

If this is all you have to say, doing it manually may be as fast as 
doing it automatically. However, if the line containing "etc .. etc 
.." is two full pages of text, you may feel differently. Then, the 
best may be to upload a prewritten letter. 
    Many Procomm users prefer to split the job in two. They enter 
the first four lines manually, and upload the body of the text 
(when the remote computer is ready to receive). 
    Press PgUp to get a menu of various uploading protocols. Select 
ASCII for transfer of plain text. Procomm will ask for the name of 
the file, which contains your letter. Enter the name, and the file 
will be sent. 

Slow down with "pacing"
-----------------------
Sometimes, the PgUp method is just what you need. On other days, 
strange things may stop you in the middle of your transfer. One 
typical reason is that Procomm is sending it too fast for the 
recipient. 
    "Pacing" is a method used to slow the speed of the transfer to 
a level that the recipient can handle. 
    Procomm lets you set a tiny pause after each line sent. Another 
technique is to ask the program to wait for a given character (a 
"Go-character"), before allowing it to send the next line. For 
example: the character ":" is often used in the prompts for the 
next line on bulletin boards. 

Protocol transfers may be easier
--------------------------------
You may find it easier to use a transfer protocol. With Procomm, 
press the PgUp key, and the program will ask for a protocol. Select 
Kermit or something else. The program will ask for a file name, you 
enter it, and off it goes. You will have no problems with blank 
lines, or lines that are too long.
    At times, even this will fail. The most common reasons are: 
    * The recipient requires that Procomm be set for 8-bits word 
length, no parity, 1 stop bit, when using this protocol, but you 
have it set differently. 
    * You think that the recipient's version of YMODEM is the same 
that you have. Wrong! Total failure.
    Do the following to upload the file TEST.TXT to my bulletin 
board using XMODEM:

    1. Navigate to the file area. Tell SHS what you want by using 
       the following command:
              u;test.txt;x
    2. Press PgUp, select XMODEM, enter a file name (TEST.TXT), and 
       the transfer will start. (If you're too slow, SHS may be
       tired of waiting for your commands . . .)
    3. When the transfer is completed, my board will ask for a 
       short description of the file. Enter it, and you're done. 

Enter G (for Goodbye), and disconnect.

ANSI
----
(1) ANSI is an organization that sets standards. 
(2) 'ANSI graphics' (ref. the term ANSI-BBS) is a set of cursor 
control codes that originated on the VT100 terminal. Many online 
services use these codes to help improve the sending of characters 
to communication programs. It uses the escape character, followed 
by other characters, to move the cursor on the screen, change 
color, and more. 

Archie
------
An electronic directory service for locating information throughout 
the Internet. You can use Archie to locate files on anonymous ftp 
archive sites, other online directories and resource listings. It 
is useful for finding free software. 
    Archie offers access to the "whatis" description database. 
This database contains descriptions that include the name and a 
brief synopsis of the large number of public domain software, 
datasets and informational documents located on the Internet. 
    This book emphasizes email access to Archie. You can also reach 
archie servers by telnet to one of the following addresses:

    archie.rutgers.edu      128.6.18.15     (U.S.A.)

Archie server
-------------
An email-based file transfer facility offered by some systems 
connected to the Internet. 

ASCII
-----
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A standard 
seven-bit code created to achieve compatibility between various 
types of data processing equipment.  ASCII, pronounced "ask-key," 
is the common code for microcomputer equipment. 
    The Standard ASCII Character Set consists of 128 decimal 
numbers ranging from zero through 127 assigned to letters, numbers, 
punctuation marks, and the most common special characters. 
    The Extended ASCII Character Set also consists of 128 decimal 
numbers and ranges from 128 through 255 representing additional 
special, mathematical, graphic, and foreign characters. 

ASCII download
--------------
Retrieval of plain ASCII text (without special codes). Normally, it 
takes place without automatic error correction, but it is typically 
managed by XON/XOFF flow control. 

Asynchronous transfer
---------------------
Serial communication between two computers. When signals are sent 
to a computer at irregular intervals, they are described as 
asynchronous. Data is sent at irregular intervals by preceding each 
character with a start bit and following it with a stop bit. 
    Asynchronous transmission allows a character to be sent at 
random after the preceding character has been sent, without regard 
to any timing device.  Consequently, in case of line noise, the 
modem can find out right away where the next byte should start. 

Autodial
--------
When a modem dials a telephone number automatically. Autodial may 
be started by the user entering the number manually, or the number 
may be sent automatically by the communications program (for 
example after having been selected from a phone register). 

Baud
----
A unit of measurement that shows the number of discrete signal 
elements, such as bits, that can be sent per second. 
    Bits per second (bps) is the number of binary digits sent in 
one second.  There is a difference between bps and baud rate, and 
the two are often confused.  For example, a device such as a modem 
said to send at 2400 baud is not correct. It actually sends 2400 
bits per second. 
    Both baud rate and bps refer to the rate at which the bits 
within a single frame are sent. The gaps between the frames can be 
of variable length.  Accordingly, neither baud rate nor bps refer 
accurately to the rate at which information is actually being 
transferred. 

BBS
---
Bulletin Board or Bulletin Board System. See Bulletin Board. 

Bell
----
Standard frequencies used in older modems made in the United 
States. The standard for 300 bps is called Bell 103. The standard 
for 1200 bps full duplex is called Bell 212A. Modems using these 
standards are normally unable to communicate with CCITT standard 
modems at these speeds. 

Big5
----
Coding scheme developed in Taiwan for using Chinese on computers. 
There are different varieties of Big5 codes, the most common being 
ET Big5 (the code used by the Taiwanese program ETen, pronounced 
Yi3tian1) and HKU Big5 (the code used for programs developed at 
Hong Kong University). 
    ET Big5 files must be read with the ETen operating system.

Binary
------
The base 2 number system in which only the digits 1 and 0 are used 
is called the binary system. The binary system lets us express any 
number, if we have enough bits, as a combination of 1's and 0's. 
Also used to express conditions like on/off, true/false, yes/no.  

Bits
----
Bit is an abbreviation for Binary digIT. Computer words and data 
are made-up of bits, the smallest unit of information.  
    A bit can be either zero or one, represented in a circuit by an 
off or on state, respectively.  The bits are set on or off to store 
data, or to form a code that in turn sends instructions to the 
computer's central processing unit. 

Bits per second (bps)
---------------------
Bits per second (bps) is the number of binary digits sent in one 
second. It refers to the rate at which the bits within a single 
frame are sent ('frame' is another term for 'packet'). The gaps 
between frames can be of variable length.  Accordingly, bps does 
not refer to the rate at which information is actually being 
transferred. 
    We usually estimate the amount of characters transferred per 
second (cps) by dividing the number of bps by 10. Example: 2400 bps 
transfers around 240 characters per second.

Boolean
-------
Search algorithm built on the algebraic theories of the English 
mathematician George Booles. Boolean algorithms are used in online 
databases to help narrow down the number of hits using the words 
AND, OR, and NOT. 

Bounce
------
The return of a piece of mail because of an error in its delivery.

Bps
---
Abbreviation for bits per second. See above.

Browse
------
To view and possibly edit a file of data on screen similar to 
handling text in a word processing document. 

Bulletin board
--------------
A computer, often a microcomputer, set up to receive calls and 
work as an online service. The BBSes let users communicate with 
each other through message bases, and exchange files. They and may 
also offer other services (like news, data base searches, and 
online shopping). 

Carrier
-------
The tone that the modem sends over a phone line before any data is 
sent on it. This tone has a fixed frequency and a fixed amplitude. 
It is then modified to indicate data. 

Character
---------
Here used about a letter, a number or another typographical symbol 
or code. 

CCITT
-----
The Consultative Committee for International Telephony and 
Telegraphy. An international consultative committee, organized by 
the United Nations. Membership includes Telephone, governmental 
Post, and Telegraph Authorities, scientific and trade associations, 
and private companies.  CCITT is part of the International 
Telecommunications Union, a United Nations treaty organization 
based in Geneva, Switzerland. 
    CCITT sets international communications recommendations. These
are often adopted as standards. It also develops interface, modem, 
and data network recommendations. The X.25 protocol for access to 
packet-switched networks was originally a recommendation of CCITT. 
    A wide range of CCITT documents is available through The 
Teledoc database of The International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU): 

   * CCITT and CCIR administrative documents
   * lists of contributions (substantive input/proposals)
     to CCITT and CCIR study groups
   * lists of CCITT reports and Recommendations
     (i.e., standards)
   * summaries of CCITT new or revised Recommendations
   * CCITT and CCIR meeting schedules and other
     information concerning Study Groups structures
     and activities.

For information, write to shaw@itu.arcom.ch or bautista@itu.arcom.ch 
The database is at teledoc@itu.arcom.ch . 

COM port 
--------
A COM port (or communication port) is a communications channel or 
pathway over which data is transferred between remote computing 
devices. 
    MS-DOS computers may have as many as four COM ports, COM1, COM2, 
COM3, and COM4.  These are serial ports most often used with a 
modem to set up a communications channel over telephone lines. They 
can also be used to send data to a serial printer, or to connect a 
serial mouse. 

Conference
----------
Also called SIG (Special Interest Group), Forum, RoundTable, Echo.
A conference is an area on a bulletin board or online service set 
up as a mini board. Most conferences have separate message bases 
and often also file libraries and bulletins. Conferences are 
focused on topics, like politics, games, multimedia and product 
support. 

Connect time
------------
A term used for the hours, minutes, and seconds that a user is 
connected to an online service. On several commercial services, 
users have to pay for connect time. 

CPS
---
Characters per second. See Bits per second.

Data
----
Information of any kind, including binary, decimal or hexadecimal 
numbers, integer numbers, text strings, etc.

Database
--------
A database is a highly structured file (or set of files) that tries 
to provide all the information assigned to a particular subject and 
to allow programs to access only items they need. 
    Online services offer databases that users can search to find 
full-text or bibliographic references to desired topics. 

DCE/DTE
-------
Data Communications Equipment/Data Terminal Equipment. Equipment 
connected to an RS232 connector must be either a DCE (like a modem 
or a printer) or a DTE (computer or terminal). The term defines the 
types of equipment that will "talk" and "listen." 

Default
-------
When a value, parameter, attribute, or option is assigned by a 
communications program, modem, or online system unless something 
else is specified, it is called the default. 
    For example, communication programs often have prespecified 
values for baud rate, bit size and parity that are used unless 
alternative values are given.  These prespecified values are called 
the defaults. 
    Some services give users a choice between two or more options. 
If a selection is not made by the user, then a selection is 
automatically assigned, by default. 

Discussion list
---------------
See Mailing list.

Domain Name System (DNS)
------------------------
Email addressing system used in networks such as Internet and 
BITNET. The Internet DNS consists of a hierarchical sequence of 
names, from the most specific to the most general (left to right), 
separated by dots, for example nic.ddn.mil. 

Doors
-----
A service offered by many bulletin boards to allow the user to 
leave the (remote) main software system to use one or several 
independent programs, like games and databases. 

Downloading
-----------
The transfer of data from an online service and "down" to your 
computers' disk.

DTR
---
Data Terminal Ready is a circuit which, when ON, tells the modem 
that your computer is ready to communicate. Most modems are unable 
to tell your computer that a connection has been set up with a 
remote computer before this circuit has been switched off. If your 
computer turns this signal OFF, while it is in a dialog with a 
remote computer, the modem will normally disconnect. 

Duplex
------
Describes how you see text entered by the keyboard. When the 
setting is HALF DUPLEX, all characters entered on your computer for 
transfer to an online service (or your modem) will be displayed. In 
addition, you will normally receive an echo from the online service 
(or modem). The result will often 'bbee lliikkee tthhiiss'. 
    When using the setting FULL DUPLEX, typed characters will not 
be shown. What you see, are characters echoed back to you from the 
online service and/or your modem. 

ECHO
----
(1) When data is being sent, the receiving device often resends the 
information back so the sending device can be sure it was received 
correctly. 
(2) Term used on FidoNet for this network's system of exchanging 
conferences (parallel conferencing). 

Email
-----
Abbreviation for Electronic Mail.

FAQ
---
"Frequently Asked Questions" about services on the Internet. A list 
of FAQ documents is posted every four to six weeks to the Usenet 
newsgroup news.announce.newusers. 

File server
-----------
A file server is a device that "serves" files to everyone on a 
network. It allows everyone on the network to get files in a single 
place, on one computer. Typically, it is a combination computer, 
data management software, and large capacity hard disk drive.

File transfer
-------------
The copying of a file from one computer to another over a computer 
network.

Finger
------
A program on computers directly connected to the Internet that 
returns information about a registered user on a system. Finger is 
useful before initiating chats, known on the Internet as "talk." 

Flame
-----
A "flame" is a conference message sent by someone who generally 
disagrees so violently that they are willing to sink to personal 
attacks. Flames can be extremely annoying, and can get the writer 
banished from several conference networks.

Fractal
--------
A mathematical algorithm from which an image can be created. A 
fractal formula generates a fractal picture composed of an image 
based on a basic pattern. An outgrowth of chaos mathematics, it is 
being used for compressing and decompressing high quality images. 
Generally, a fractally compressed image has an extremely small file 
size. 

FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
----------------------------
A program on the Internet for sending and receiving files to and 
from a remote computer to your local host. FTP lets you connect to 
many remote computers, as an anonymous or guest user, to transfer 
files back to your computer. 
    FTP only lets you list file directories on foreign systems, and 
get or retrieve files. You cannot browse menus, send email, or 
search databases.
    Usually, type ftp at your system prompt, login on the remote 
system, and ask for the file you want to receive. It transfers to 
your local host machine. (For more on this, read under "Internet" 
in appendix 1.) 
    Unless your computer is directly connected to the Internet, the 
retrieved software will have to be transferred from your local host 
machine to your PC. 
    Where ftp is not available, you may use FTPMAIL (see chapter 
12). 

Full duplex
-----------
The term full-duplex means the transmission of data in two 
directions simultaneously as from a terminal to a computer or from 
the computer to the terminal. Full-duplex is simultaneous two-way 
communication. 

Full-text database
------------------
A database containing the full text of an article, a chapter in a 
book, or a book. The contents are not limited to abstracted 
information (indexes, bibliographic information). 

FYI
---
"For Your Information." On the Internet, a subseries of RFCs that 
are not technical standards or descriptions of protocols. 

Gateway
-------
Here, we use the term gateway about an interconnection between two 
(or more) online services, set up to allow a user of one service to 
use the other service's offerings through the first service's user 
interface. 
    The term also has other meanings:
    A gateway provides an interconnection between two networks with 
different communications protocols. Gateways operate at the 4th 
through 7th layer of the OSI model. For example, a PAD (a packet 
assembler/disassembler) is a device used to interface non-X.25 
devices to an X.25 network.  The PAD serves as a gateway. Protocol 
converters are gateways between networks. 
    The gateway, provided by an adapter card in a workstation, 
enables the network to perform as if it were a mainframe terminal 
connected directly to the mainframe. 

Gopher
------
A world wide information service with many implementations. It 
works from a top-level subject-oriented menu system that accesses 
other information services across the Internet. Gopher combines a 
finding and fetching capability in one tool. 
    Gopher gets information from certain locations on the Internet 
to which it is connected, and brings the information to your 
computer. It can also get information via other Gophers at other 
locations connected to yet other hosts. The Telneting or file
transfer protocols are transparent to the user. 
    "Common Questions and Answers about the Internet Gopher" are 
posted to the following Usenet newsgroups comp.infosystems.gopher, 
comp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks. 
    The most recent version of this FAQ is also available by 
anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the /pub/usenet/news.answers 
directory. The file is called gopher.faq. 
    To get it by email, write mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the 
command "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body of 
the text. 

GuoBiao
-------
Coding scheme for using Chinese on computers developed in mainland 
China. For more information, send email to LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET with 
one of the following commands in the text of your mail:
    GET PC HELP                   (for PC users)
    GET MAC HELP                  (Macintosh users)
    GET CXTERM HELP               (X Windows users)

Half duplex
-----------
The term half-duplex means the transmission of data in either 
direction but only one direction at a time.

real name. Often used in chats.

Header
------
(1) In an email message, the part that precedes the body of a 
message and contains, among other things, the message originator, 
date and time. 
(2) On a packet switched network, the portion of a package, 
preceding the actual data, containing source and destination 
addresses, and error checking and other fields. 

Host
----
A term for host computer, remote computer or online service. Here, 
we use it about a timesharing computer, a BBS system, or a central 
computer that controls a network and delivers online services.

Information utility 
-------------------
A term often used about online services (not unlike the term power 
utility). 

Internet
--------
See appendix 1.

Internet number
---------------
See IP Address

IP (Internet Protocol)
----------------------
The Internet standard protocol that provides a common layer over 
dissimilar networks, used to move packets between host computers 
and through gateways if necessary. 
   For more information, send a message to service@nic.ddn.mil with 
the following text in the subject title: RFC 791 .

IP Address
----------
Every machine on the Internet has a unique address, called its 
Internet number or IP address. Usually, this address is represented 
by four numbers joined by periods ('.'), like 129.133.10.10. 
    The first two or three pieces represent the network that the 
system is on, called its subnet. For example, all of the computers 
for Wesleyan University in the U.S.A. are in the subnet 129.133, 
while the number in the previous paragraph represents a full 
address to one of the university's computers. 

IRC
---
Internet Relay Chat is a worldwide "party line" protocol that 
allows one to converse with others in real time. 

ISDN
----
An emerging technology being offered by many telephone carriers of 
the world. ISDN combines voice and digital network services in a 
single medium, making it possible to offer customers digital data 
services as well as voice connections through a single "wire." The 
standards that define ISDN are specified by CCITT. 

ISO 
---
The International Organization for Standardization. A voluntary, 
nontreaty organization responsible for creating international 
standards in many areas, including computers and communications. 
Its members are the national standards organizations of the 89 
member countries, including ANSI for the U.S. 
    ISO is coordinator of the main Internet networking standards 
that are in use today. 
    ISO@NIC.DDN.MIL is a mailing list focusing on the ISO protocol 
stack.

JIS
---
A Japanese industry standard code for presenting the Japanese 
character set Kanji on computers. JIS defines special ranges of 
user-defined characters. Only the most popular ones are included.
    The newer Shift JIS standard sets aside certain character codes 
to signal the start of a two-character sequence. Together, these 
define a single Kanji metacharacter. 
    There are many oddities to be found in handling Kanji over the 
network. Sending JIS-encoded messages through the Internet is done 
using a 7-bit code (standardized on JUNET). Unfortunately, it 
incorporates the ESC character, which some systems will filter out. 
(This problem can be overcome by using UUENCODing.) 
    Some services, like APICNET in Tokyo, converts outgoing Kanji 
messages automatically to 7-bit format. 

JVArcServ 
---------
Archive server for FidoNet modelled after Archie for the Internet. 
It maintains file lists from FidoNet systems throughout its area 
and will do searches on these file lists based on netmail requests 
made to it by remote systems. 
   JVArcServ lets you search through file listings for the program 
you are looking for. It will send you an email message back telling 
you the BBS name, phone number, and file section of all the systems 
in the network that match the given criteria.

control and data compression.

Modem
-----
An acronym for MOdulator-DEModulator.  It is a device that converts 
digital data from a computer or terminal into analog data that can 
be sent over telephone lines.  On the receiving end, it converts 
the analog data back to digital data. 
    Most modern modems can handle the dialing and answering of a 
telephone call and generate the speed of the data transmission, 
measured in bits per second, or baud rates. The telephone industry 
sometimes refers to a modem as a dataset.

alpha-geometric and alpha-photographic constructs. The standard is 
resolution independent and device independent, and can easily 
accommodate international character sets, bit-mapped images in 
color, animation and sound. 
    NAPLPS was originally developed for videotext and teletext 
systems through the Canadian Standards Association (CSA-T500-1983.  
It was later enhanced by AT&T, and in 1983 became an ANSI standard 
(ANSI-X3.110-1983). 
    Some videotext systems, including Prodigy (U.S.A.), are based 
on NAPLPS. On CompuServe, NAPLPS has been replaced with a newer 
protocol called GIF, Graphics Interchange Format.

Offline
-------
has the opposite meaning of "Online" (see below). It signifies 
that your computer is not in direct communication with a remote 
online service. 

Offline Reader
--------------
A computer program making the handling of mail and files from 
online services easier (and cheaper). Some also provides automatic 
mail and file transfers. 
    Typically, you first connect to an online service (often a BBS) 
to capture new mail in a compressed file (typically through a 
"QMail door program.") Many offline mail reader programs are idle 
while this goes on, while others can do communications as well. 
    When disconnected from the service, the offline reader works as 
a combination message data base and message editor. It gives you 
the feeling of still being connected to the online service, while 
actually being completely disconnected. 
    When you have read and replied to all messages offline, the 
offline reader creates a compressed "packet" containing any replies 
entered. Some also let you prepare packets containing commands to 
join or leave conferences, subscribe to or signoff from special 
services, and download files. 
    Then, you dial back to the BBS to upload (send) the packet, 
either using the offline reader's communications module, or another 
communications program. 
    Readers are available for MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Macintosh, Amiga, 
Atari ST, Unix, and CP/M computers. The programs may be downloaded 
from many BBSes, and commercial services. 

Online
------

Packet
------
(1) A group of bits sent by a modem that comprise a byte of 
information. 
(2) A group of bytes sent by a file transfer protocol. 

Packet data networks
--------------------
Also called Packet Switching Networks (PDN). Value added networks 
offering long distance computer communications. They let users 
access a remote computer, by dialing a local node, or access point. 
    The packet data networks use high speed digital links, which 
can be land lines or satellite communications, to transmit data 
from one computer to another using packets of data.  They use 
synchronous communications, usually with the X.25 protocol.  The 
routes are continually optimized, and successive packets of the 
same message need not necessarily follow the same path. 

Packet switching
----------------
Sending data in packets through a network to some remote location. 
The data to be sent is subdivided into individual packets of data, 
each having a unique identification and carrying its destination 
address. This allows each packet to go by a different route. The 
packet ID lets the data be reassembled in proper sequence.

mail problems, answering queries about users, and other related 
work at a site. 

Prompt
------
Several times during interactive dialogs with online services, the 
flow of data stops while the host computer waits for commands from 
the user. At this point, the service often presents the user with a 
reminder, a cue, a prompt. These are some typical prompts: 

    ?
    !
    WHAT NOW?
    (Read) next letter -
    ulrik 1>
    System News - 5000>

------
A program on the Internet that allows logins to another computer to 
run software there. Telnet allows a user at one site to interact 
with a remote system at another site as if the user's terminal was 
connected directly to the remote computer. 
    With telnet, you can browse menus, read text files, use gopher 
services, and search online databases. Sometimes, you can join 
live, interactive games and chat with other callers. Usually, you 
cannot download files or list file directories. 
    Telnet is not available to users who have email only access to 
the Internet. 
    To telnet a remote computer, you must know its name. This can 
either be in words, like "vm1.nodak.edu", or a numeric address, 
like "134.129.111.1". Some services require that you connect to a 
specific "port" on the remote system. Enter the port number, if 
there is one, after the Internet address. 
    For a list of SPECIAL INTERNET CONNECTIONS, send email to

as a gopher menu. The user can access any of these data items by 
selecting from the returned menu. 

WAIS (Wide Area Information Servers)
------------------------------------
A kind of indexed online search tool to locate items based on what 
they contain - usually keyword text searches. It is a powerful tool 
for concurrent searches of large databases and/or newsgroups on the 
Internet. 
    Example: Telnet QUAKE.THINK.COM (or Telnet 192.31.181.1). Login 
as "wais".

WAN
---
Wide Area Network.

The 'whatis' database
---------------------
Archie (see above) also permits access to the whatis description 
database. It contains the names and brief synopses of over 3,500 
public domain software packages, datasets and informational 
documents located on the Internet.

Whois
-----

other Internet entities, such as domains, networks, and hosts, kept 
at the NIC (see above). 
    For example, Whois lets you scan through a registry of 
researchers in the network field to find an Internet address, if 
you have only the last name or part of it. It will give you the 
person's company name, address, phone number, and email address. It 
had around 70,000 listings in December 1992.        
    To access the WHOIS, telnet to rs.internic.net. When greeted by

X.25
----
A CCITT standard communications protocol used internationally in 
packet data networks. It provides error-checked communication 
between packet data networks and their users or other networks. 
    Rather than sending a stream of bits like a modem, an X.25 
router sends packets of data.  There are different packet sizes and 
types. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, information 
about the packet's origin, destination, size, and its place in the 
order of the packets sent.  There are clear packets that perform 
the equivalent of hanging-up the phone.  There are reset, restart, 
and diagnostic packets.  On the receiving end, the packet 
assembler/ disassembler (PAD) in the router translates the packets 
back into a readable format.
