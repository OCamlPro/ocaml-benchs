                                TO THE RIVER --
                               by Edgar Allan Poe

      Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow
        Of crystal, wandering water,
      Thou art an emblem of the glow
          Of beauty- the unhidden heart-
          The playful maziness of art
      In old Alberto's daughter;

      But when within thy wave she looks-
        Which glistens then, and trembles-
      Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
        Her worshipper resembles;
      For in his heart, as in thy stream,
        Her image deeply lies-
      His heart which trembles at the beam
        Of her soul-searching eyes.

                    -THE END-
